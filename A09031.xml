            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE SVMME OF THE Eleuen firſt Chapters of the EPISTLE to the Romanes.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Aint <hi>Paul</hi> in the eleuen firſt Chapters of this Epiſtle, intreateth of Iuſtification: his order is this: In the fiue firſt, hee proueth againſt all obiections of Iewes and Gentiles, that all men are iuſtified by the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Ieſus Chriſt, apprehended by Faith. In the ſixe next, hee ouerthrowes the engines whereby Satan went about to oppugne this heauenly Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Theſe Engines were 4. Firſt, that this Doctrine brings in liberty and licentious liuing. 2. That it makes God incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and not ſo good as his word to the Iewes. 3. That it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſheth the righteouſneſſe of the Law. 4. That from thence it followes, that GOD hath quite caſt away the people of the Iewes. The firſt of theſe <hi>Paul</hi> remoues, Chapter 6. 7. 8. the ſecond; Chapter 9. the third; Chapter 10. the fourth; Chapter eleuen.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 6.</note> The Doctrine of Grace, teacheth men, not to liue looſely, but to deny all vngodlineſſe, and to walke in newneſſe of life. Therefore all beleeuers are to fight againſt ſin, which they may doe, with ſo much the more comfort, in as much as they are not vnder the Law, but vnder Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 7.</note> Indeed, before they were conuerted, they were ſubiect to the curſe of the Law, and by it became more ſinfull; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receiued Grace to beleeue, they are freed by Ieſus Chriſt, <pb facs="tcp:14442:8"/>notwithſtanding, the luſting of the fleſh againſt the Spirit, which is the condition of euery regenerate man in this life.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 8.</note> Therefore, though ſinne remaine in them, and for it they bee chaſtiſed of God, yet it raignes not in them, nor can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them, neither can any tribulations ſeparate them from the loue of God in Chriſt.</p>

               <p>The Conſolation is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, againſt two ſpeciall ſore tentations, whereby it might ſeeme that a regenerate man were miſerable, and deſtitute of inward peace: the one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the remainder of ſinne; then which nothing is more heauy: the other from the Croſſe, then which nothing is more bitter.</p>

                  <p>IN this verſe are two things, 1. The Conſolatory propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>There is no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt.</hi> 2. A deſcription of one of the Termes, namely, <hi>Who are in Chriſt,</hi> ſuch as <hi>walke not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Propoſition (as in all of this kind) there are 3. parts. 1. The ſubiect or Antecedent, <hi>To them which are in Chriſt,</hi>
2. the Predicat or Conſequent, <hi>Condemnation,</hi> 3. the Bond, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiuely ſet downe, <hi>There is no.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The whole Propoſition in the naturall order, is thus, <hi>To them which are in Chriſt, there is no condemnation.</hi> This order is inuerted for more Elegancy and force.</p>
                  <p>The Arguments diſpoſed in this propoſition, are the cauſe, and the contrary effect. The contrary effect negatiuely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered of the cauſe. The cauſe, <hi>beeing in Chriſt.</hi> The contrary effect,
<hi>Condemnation.</hi> The proper effect, Iuſtification, ſet down negatiuely for our greater comfort: becauſe wee are more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the euill things we are freed from, which wee haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, then of the good things we haue by Grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is therefore now.</hi>

                     </note> Some make this particle <hi>(Now)</hi> an Aduerbe of Time, in a double relation. Firſt, to the time paſt, thus: before; when you were out of Chriſt, your eſtate was damnable; but <hi>now</hi> it is otherwiſe. Secondly, to the time to come, viz. Of the glorification of the body, thus, <hi>Now</hi> there is no condemnation; then there ſhall be no concupiſcence. But it's better taken for a note of inference from ſomewhat going before, thus: Thoſe which are iuſtified, are not vnder the Law, but vnder Grace. <hi>Now</hi> then it followes, that there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to ſuch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is no condemnation.</hi> Condemnation is a ſentence or Doome giuen by a competent Iudge, concerning the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an offender, the contrary whereof, is Abſolution, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting, Iuſtification. The Iudge is GOD. The delinquent to be arraigned, ſinfull Man, the Court double, Inferior: of Conſcience, Superior: of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:14442:9"/>
                     <hi>To them which bee in Chriſt.</hi> In Chriſt, and by Chriſt, differ: by the firſt, effectuall Vocation; by the ſecond, Iuſtification is vſually ſet forth. To bee in Chriſt, is to bee vnited vnto him: which vnion is ſpirituall, not corporall. Hee in vs by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, wee in him by our Faith.</p>
                  <p>The meaning ariſeth from the coniunction of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and Predicat by a Negatiue Bond: for though they are ioyned in the Propoſition, yet they are really ſeparated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To them which are in Chriſt.</hi> That is, which beleeue, and ſo are effectually called, <hi>there is no condemnation,</hi> (not before men, for ſuch are moſt ſubiect to reproachfull cenſures, but before) God; either at the Barre of their owne Conſcience, or at the Barre of Chriſt, at the laſt day. The terror of damnation is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable, ſpecially before the Iudgement ſeat of CHRIST; for, if the iudgement of a guilty Conſcience be ſo fearefull, as wee cannot be ignorant, much more is the iudgement of God, who is greater then our Conſcience.

But heare and tremble thou Profane. There is no Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them which are in Chriſt. This is the Childrens bread, it is not for Dogs, that is, for Impenitent ſinners.

Yet, yet conuert: that if it be poſſible, thou mayſt eſcape Damnation: Yet leaue thy Whoredomes &amp;c. While the doore of grace is open. He which now ſtoppeth his eare: O, how ſhall he in That day call to the Mountaines and Rockes to couer him! Preuent this damnation by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and though other fall into hell, labour thou to bee in the number of them to whom there is no Condemnation.</p>

That tormenting flame, ſhall not touch one hayre of your heads: As the garments of the three men ſmelt not of the fire; ſo you ſhall bee moſt free. Remember this golden, this moſt diuine Sentence, and in all diſtreſſes of Conſcience conquer yee. But thou wilt ſay: Alas, I am led captiue vnto ſinne, what hope therefore? Indeede in thy ſelfe there is none; but in Chriſt there is plenty. When Satan ſhall trouble thee, looke vnto Chriſt, in whom thou art by Faith, and Inuincibly relye here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon: There is no Condemnation to men in Chriſt. See thou haſt good euidence of thy being in Chriſt, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue that it is as poſſible for Chriſt himſelfe to bee damned, as for thee. For thou art a part and a member of him, which to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh is impoſſible. Examine thy Faith and Repentance, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to feele in thy heart, thy vnion with thy Sauiour. It is not enough to be neere him; thou muſt be in him.

                  <p n="1">1. Trauellers, ignorant of the way, enquire after the right and neereſt way. So wouldſt thou trauell to heauen? If thou enquireſt for the way of Merit, it is Chriſt. If for the way of our Obedience, it is the Law. There are many by-pathes. Search the Scriptures, the Rule of our Faith and Obedience.

This Spirit is two wayes ſet forth. Firſt, by the Subiect in whom it is. It is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically in Chriſt.

                  <p>The meaning then is this. The power of the Spirit which is in Chriſt, hath freed all them which are in Chriſt, from ſinne and death. So that as ſinne could haue no power ouer him to condemne him, neither can it haue ouer vs; wee receiuing of the ſame Spirit, and liuing the ſame life which was in him: For we liue not a diuerſe life from that which is in Chriſt, but the very ſame, as the water in the fountaine, and riuers; and the life in the head and members is the ſame.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>There is much diuerſity in the reading of theſe words: That of <hi>Camerarius</hi> is very plaine; but the beſt and plaineſt, is that of his Maieſties tranſlation, which I follow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:14442:15"/>In theſe words of the Neceſſity are two things. 1. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vttered of the Law, viz. that it could not
<hi>deliuer vs.</hi> 2. The reaſon: Becauſe it is <hi>weake through the Fleſh.</hi> This is brought in by a <hi>Prolepſis,</hi> Thus. What needs deliuerance by Chriſt, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wee haue the Law which promiſeth
<hi>life</hi> to the obſeruers? If the Law be able to deliuer, what need Chriſt? If not able, what auailes the Law?</p>
                  <p>To this <hi>Paul</hi> anſweres by a Conceſſion: That indeed the Law is <hi>not able,</hi> and therefore GOD ſent his
<hi>Sonne,</hi> to do that which was impoſſible to the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This then is affirmed by</hi> Paul, <hi>that the Law cannot iuſtifie and deliuer,</hi> Acts 13.38,39. Heb. 7.18.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What vſe then of the Law?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Very great. It teacheth vs Gods will concerning Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; it ſhews what is <hi>right</hi> and <hi>wrong:</hi> It is a
<hi>Schoole-maſter to bring vs to Chriſt,</hi> and the Goſpel. So that, though the Law can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſaue vs; yet, neither can the Goſpel without the Law, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> 
                     <hi>Ambroſe</hi> elegantly ſets forth by a ſimilitude of the vpper and nether <hi>Milſtone:</hi> The Law <hi>(ſaith he)</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ambroſius Ser.</hi> 29. <hi>per. totum.</hi>
                     </note> is as the <hi>nether-Milſtone,</hi> which is ſlow and ſtirreth not; the Goſpell quick as the <hi>vpper-Milſtone;</hi> without which the <hi>nether-Milſtone</hi> may ſeeme vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. Yet, cannot the
<hi>vpper</hi> grind without the <hi>nether,</hi> but both together make
<hi>good Meale.</hi> So, Iuſtification as <hi>fine Flower,</hi> is between the Law and the Goſpell, prepared for vs.</p>
                  <p>Seeke not Iuſtification by the Law. This were to ſeeke
<hi>Life</hi> in <hi>Death, Heauen</hi> in <hi>Hell, Saluation</hi> in
<hi>Condemnation.</hi> There are two things neceſſary to ſaluation: Iuſtification and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Law can giue neither of theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pardon</hi> ſinne it cannot,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26.</note> for it is the Office of the Law to <hi>curſe</hi> tranſgreſſors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Renew</hi> vnto holineſſe it cannot; though it <hi>can command</hi> vs to <hi>be holy.</hi> The Law is holy in it ſelfe. But to bee holy, and <hi>to make holy</hi> are two things: <hi>That,</hi> the Law is: in
<hi>This,</hi> the Law is impotent.</p>
                  <p>Vaine therefore is the hope of many, who thinke to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued only by their good ſeruing God, and their iuſt dealing: and that their
<hi>good deeds</hi> ſhall preuaile againſt their <hi>badde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For firſt, our beſt deeds haue ſo much defect, that though in <pb n="16" facs="tcp:14442:16"/>ſome conſideration they might bee
<hi>worthy;</hi> yet in other, they ſtand in need of <hi>pardon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, all our good deeds, though wee had as many as
<hi>Abraham,</hi> are of finite perfection, and therefore cannot
<hi>ſatisfie</hi> for the leaſt ſinne, whereby an Infinite Maieſtie is
<hi>offended.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if wee could doe good <hi>perfectly,</hi> yet ſuch doing is <hi>duty,</hi> and duty <hi>diſchargeth</hi> no debt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In that it was weake through the fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Law cannot deliuer. The reaſon, becauſe it is too
<hi>weake.</hi> How comes it to bee weake? It is <hi>weakened through the fleſh.</hi> That is corrupted, ſinfull, rebellious nature.</p>
                  <p>The Law is not <hi>weakened,</hi> either in <hi>Precept</hi> or in <hi>Doctrine;</hi> but onely in <hi>Iuſtifying</hi> of Man: and this not <hi>in it ſelfe;</hi> but by <hi>accident,</hi> becauſe wee are naught, and not conformable vnto it: If wee could perfectly keepe the Law, it were as able to iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vs, <hi>as euer.</hi> There is no fault then in the Law, but in vs.</p>
                  <p>A blind man cannot ſee, though the <hi>Sunne</hi> ſhine moſt cleere: The fault is not in the Sunne, but in his blind eyes. So, that wee are not benefited by the Law, is our fault, not the Lawes.</p>
                  <p>A cunning <hi>Caruer,</hi> can cut the <hi>ſimilitude</hi> of any Creature; but not on a Rotten ſticke; yet, no imputation to the
<hi>Caruer.</hi> So the Law hath skill to <hi>Iuſtifie;</hi> but cannot doe this feat in our <hi>Rotten Nature.</hi>

2. The Act <hi>Sending.</hi> 3. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>In the likeneſſe of ſinfull fleſh.</hi> 4. The End, to take away ſinne.</p>

The Anſwer is, that Chriſt is to be conſidered two wayes: As God; and as the Mediator of God and Man: And this ſending to be meant; not of a locall motion from Heauen to Earth, but of his manifeſtation in the Fleſh. <hi>Sent,</hi> ſaith one,

                     </note> not that he might be where he was not, but that he might bee in the manner that he was not: that is, viſibly in regard of his aſſumed Fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>In the likeneſſe of ſinfull Fleſh. Fleſh</hi> is not here to be taken for Corruption; but for the ſubſtance of mans Nature: The word <hi>Likeneſſe,</hi> is not to bee attributed to
<hi>Fleſh,</hi> but to <hi>Sinfull.</hi> Not fleſh in likeneſſe; For that was the Hereſie of <hi>Marcion:</hi> but ſinne in Likeneſſe. He had true Fleſh: but No Sinne. In regard of the Subſtance of the Fleſh, it was True. In regard of the Euill Qualities, it was <hi>like.</hi> He was Counted a Sinner, and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a Sinner, but he was no Sinner.

                  <p>
                     <hi>And for Sinne:</hi> that is, for the taking away of Sinne, to bee a Sacrifice for Sinne.</p>
                  <p>The meaning. It was the will of God, that Chriſt ſhould take our Nature vpon him, but without Sinne, and therein make ſatisfaction for vs, and ſo free vs from ſinne and death.</p>
                  <p>So that theſe words are (as we may ſay) a Commiſſion from God the Father to Chriſt. In which are three things. 1. The Author, God the Father. 2. The Committee, Chriſt the Sonne. <pb n="19" facs="tcp:14442:17"/>3. The Summe and Contents of the Commiſsion, in two Clauſes. The firſt, to take our nature vpon him. The ſecond, in that Nature to take away ſinne. The firſt part ſhewes his Nature. The ſecond, his Office. In the firſt is the Doctrine of his Incarnation. In the ſecond, the Doctrine of his Paſsion.</p>

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> Why cannot Carnall and Spirituall, Godly, and Godleſſe men agree together?
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 29.27.</note> Why is a wicked man an abomination to the Iuſt and contrary? Heres the reaſon. They are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of contrary nature and diſpoſition: Fire and Water are not more contrary. Clay and Iron wil not weld together, ſo friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is where there is likenes: Birds of a feather will flye toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Gods Children wonder, that wicked men can bee ſo ill: and wicked men wonder that the children of God will not run with them into all exceſſe, and Ryot.</p>
                  <p>From this contrariety is it, that Adulterers, Drunkards, vaine perſons find fauour there, where a good man is hunched at. That an Idle perſon who will let his worke to runne to the Ale-houſe, and to vanity, ſhall bee borne with; but if a poore man let an houre to go to a Sermon; hee's an Hypocrite, 'tis pitty to do any thing for him. A Philoſopher being asked, why men ſought more to <hi>rich</hi> men, then to <hi>wiſe</hi> men, anſwered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was poſſible they might be <hi>rich,</hi> but not
<hi>wiſe:</hi> So, if any aske me why wicked men are of ſome more fauored, then good men: the Anſwere is ready: Becauſe they which fauour wicked men, either are, or meane to bee, Whoore-maſters, Harlots, Theeues, Drunkards, &amp;c. but to bee godly they purpoſe not.</p>
                  <p>Doeſt thou hate good men and rayle on them? Well, go too: ſhew thy ſelfe what thou art: No body hates an Iſraelite, but an
<hi>Aegyptian,</hi> or a <hi>Canaanite;</hi> no body mocks <hi>Iſaack</hi> but <hi>Iſmael:</hi> betraies CHRIST but <hi>Iudas,</hi> is an enemy to a godly man, but he which is contrary.</p>
                  <p>Put Fire to Fire, or Water to Water, and there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion: but put Fire to Water, or contrary, and then, what a noyſe and Thundring! So, if a wicked man meet with a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man, there's ſhaking of hands and much gladneſſe: but if a good man come in their way, hee's ſure not to paſſe without <pb n="30" facs="tcp:14442:23"/>a mocke or taunt. If thou feareſt God, let not this diſcourage thee. It's a ſigne there is ſome goodneſſe in thee, otherwiſe the Diuell would not in his Inſtruments ſo rage againſt thee.</p>

                  <p>Euery thing liues according to his kind: the Horſe in the Paſture: the Fiſh in the Water: A Fiſh cannot liue out of the Water: ſo talke of good things to a carnall man; he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fals aſleepe, or railes; for hee's out of his Element; but to a Spirituall man, ſuch things are a delight. As in dyet, that which is one mans meat, is another mans bane, becauſe of the difference of their <hi>temperature</hi> and conſtitution: So is it here.</p>
                  <p>Examine thy ſelfe in particular: The hearing of the Word, Prayer, &amp;c. are Spirituall. Is the Word as ſweet to thee as the Hony and the Honie-combe, as it was to <hi>Dauid?</hi> And is thy Soule neuer at reſt, till thou canſt find opportunity to powre out thy heart to GOD in Prayer? Thou art ſpirituall; theſe things are <hi>moſt tedious</hi> to a carnall man.

Flatter not thy ſelfe; thou art ſurely carnall: For a ſpirituall man hates theſe things, and all his delight is in the Saints, and in them which excell in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>

<hi>corruption,</hi> which hath infected thee.</p>
                  <p>Many think that the priuiledges of Regenerate men belong to them, becauſe now and then they goe to a Sermon, though they find no more ſauour in it, then in a dry Chippe: No, no, Thou mayſt heare many Sermons, and yet haue a carnall heart of thine owne, which if occaſion ſerue will ſhew it ſelfe. As <pb n="31" facs="tcp:14442:23"/>Water-fowles hatcht vnder a Land-fowle, a while remain with their damme; but anon runne into the Water, according to their kind. So, if the nature and diſpoſition of the heart be not <hi>changed,</hi> wee cannot ſauour and take pleaſure in good things.</p>
                  <p>As a Hare when ſhe is hotly purſued and hunted, plies her to ſome <hi>beaten-path,</hi> not for any loue ſhe hath to it, but that there, by the feet of paſſengers ſhee may loſe her ſent; ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will be in the Church paths, not for any Deuotion; but that the filthy ſent of their carnality might not be diſcouered.</p>

If <hi>Nathan</hi> had not come home to <hi>Dauids</hi> Conſcience, he would neuer haue thought himſelfe to be meant: But Then, hee is ſtriken, and repents: So then, if euer, our Profane wretches will leaue their ſinnes when they are told they are the Men, and the ſecrets of their hearts are made manifeſt.

As the former ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the happineſſe of the Godly in regard of their ſoules: ſo this in regard of their bodies: and it is inferred by an Occupation, from the words of the 10. Verſe, thus: I confeſſe, <hi>Paul</hi> (might ſome ſay) that the ſoule liues: but the Body is turned to duſt and periſheth. Nay, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Euen the body ſhall be raiſed vp and quickned, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate may be happy in body and ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words haue two parts. 1. A ſuppoſition: <hi>If the Spirit, &amp;c. dwell in you.</hi> 2. A Concluſion: <hi>Hee that raiſed vp Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Two things are ſuppoſed: 1. That the Spirit of God is in

                  <p>There are diuers Arguments whereby this Exhortation is vrged; The firſt is in the 12. verſe, which is taken from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie and Iuſtice.

                     </hi> To giue euery man his owne is the voyce of Iuſtice. But we are debters to the Spirit: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our life muſt be ſpirituall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore:</hi> an Illation ſending vs to the things before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered: wherin (me thinks) the Apoſtle dealeth like a braue Generall, who hauing ſpoken of the glory of them which conquer, and the ſhame of them which are conquered, doth animate his ſouldiers to fight it out manfully, and to ſubdue the Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren:</hi> This is an Inſinuation, the better to perſwade them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wee:</hi> Not including others, and excluding himſelfe, but concluding all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Are Debters:</hi> Debters are of two ſorts: Ciuill, which owe money, &amp;c. to men: Secondly, Theologicall: And this is alſo double. 1. Sinne. 2. or Obedience. Sinne is a debt, ſo called in the Lords Prayer, not that we owe ſinne, or that our ſinnes are owing to be done: but becauſe we owe the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be vndergone; hauing by our ſinnes forfeited body and ſoule to be damned. And therefore ſinnes are ſo called by a double figure:

                     </note> but this debt is not here meant.</p>
                  <p>The other Theologicall debt, is the debt of obedience; which we owe to God, for our Election, Vocation, Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14442:37"/>&amp;c. So it is taken here; not ſo in the Lords Prayer, for we doe not pray, neither may we, to haue the debt of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence forgiuen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Not to the Fleſh:</hi> Fleſh here, not for the body, but for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: for we are debters to the body; to cloath it, to feed it, &amp;c. that it may bee a fit inſtrument for the ſoule to ſerue God: but we are not debters to the corruption to liue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>Here the Antitheſis is omitted, but neceſſarily to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. But to the ſpirit, to liue after the ſpirit, that is, holily.</p>
                  <p>This verſe hath two parts: Firſt, an Affirmation. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, an Amplification. The Affirmation, <hi>We are debters.</hi> This is amplified; firſt, by an Illation, <hi>Therefore.</hi> Secondly, by a Friendly compellation, <hi>Brethren.</hi> Thirdly, by a generality, <hi>We.</hi> Fourthly, by the Creditor, who is here ſet downe Negatiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Not to the Fleſh.</hi> The Affirmatiue to bee ſupplied, But to the Spirit. Fiftly, by the debt which we muſt pay, <hi>Life,</hi> or <hi>liuing;</hi> that is, thoughts, words, deeds. And this is alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiuely ſet downe, and to bee marked, <hi>Not to liue after the Fleſh.</hi> For we owe ſomething to corruption, but death, not life.</p>

                  <p>IN this verſe the Apoſtle prooues, that thoſe which are led by the Spirit, are the children of God; by an effect of the Spirit in them, which is to call God, Father. Which is amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an oppoſition of their former eſtate, which was an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of ſeruile feare. As if he ſhould ſay by an Occupation: It may bee, you feare in regard of ſinne
<hi>inhabiting.</hi> But the profiting you haue made, is not in the addition of ſuch <hi>ſlauiſh feare,</hi> wherwith formerly you were poſſeſſed: but that which you haue now receiued is a more excellent effect of the ſame Spirit, which is the Grace of Adoption.</p>
                  <p>Heere two effects of the Holy Ghoſt are oppoſed: for in ſome the Spirit workes feare, in other, loue and aſſurance; and firſt, feare; then, aſſurance, that we may, ſtirred vp to ſeek aſſurance: Feare; the ſigne of the ſpirit of bondage: Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and aſſurance in God as a Father, the proper effect of the Spirit of Adoption.</p>

For the preaching of the Law, is the true cauſe of ſeruile, not filiall feare. And here the Apoſtle alludes (I take it) to the time of the Law and the giuing of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But you haue receiued the Spirit of Adoption:</hi> He ſhould haue ſaid, of <hi>Liberty;</hi> but hee ſaith more, of Adoption: for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are free.

                  <p>Adoption is a lawfull Act, imitating nature, found out for the comfort of them which haue no children: Adoption and Arrogation (which are Termes of the Ciuill Law) differ.

                  <p>The eſtate of a Sonne is diſcerned by Confidence in Prayer. Such a one is able (notwithſtanding feare) to cry Abba Father. He that can (I ſay not, ſpeake the words with a lowd voice, for ſo may a Parrat, or Hypocrite,

                  <p>This is wonderfull hard to doe: As for Inſtance.

                  <p>It is maruellous then that the Church of Rome denyeth aſſurance to Gods Children: What though ſome haue bragged of aſſurance, that haue beene deceiued? Doth it follow therefore that none are ſure? There bee ſome poore and baſe; are there therefore none rich? And what though my very name bee not written in the Scripture: Thou
<hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> Thou <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhalt be ſaued? It is not conuenient: What a huge Volume ſhould the Bible be, if euery Saints name were there written? It is not neceſſary: becauſe all particulars are included in their Generals: As he that ſaith, All my Children are here: meanes euery one in particular, though he name them not: So God, that ſaith All Beleeuers ſhall be ſaued: Meanes euery one, as though they were named.</p>

The Act of Faith is not ſet downe in the Scriptures, but the Obiect. The Faith which I beleeue is in the Bible. The Faith whereby I beleeue, is not in the Bible, but in my heart: and is not beleeued (for that were abſurd) but knowne by feeling.

                  <p n="1">1. It is an aſſurance that we are heires. The Croſſe is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and Eaſe is ſweet: but as hee who loues his money, yet willingly parteth with it, for aſſurance of his Title to an earthly inheritance: ſo, though we loue our quiet, our bloud, our liues, yet if the expence of them will confirme our Title to Heauen, we are not to diſcomfort our ſelues.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſuffer not alone, but with Chriſt. Wee are of his Order: Knights of the Croſſe. It is comfortable to haue companions in trouble; we can haue no more comfortable companion I am ſure then Chriſt, with whom I had rather bee vnder the greateſt Croſſe, then without him in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt proſperitie: euen as where Man and Wife loue, they had rather liue together in a meane eſtate, then ſeparated in the greateſt abundance. God had but one owne Son, that came into the world without ſinne, and yet hee could not <pb n="77" facs="tcp:14442:46"/>get out of it without the Croſſe: therfore be thou comforted.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Croſſe is the way to Heauen. If wee taſte not of the Croſſe, we may doubt iuſtly, that we are not in the right way. If a traueller, inquiring of the way, be told, that he ſhall at ſuch a place come to a great water; a little farther to a high hill, a little farther to a place of great danger: If he paſſe on and finde neither water, hill, nor danger, but all plaine, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and ſafe, he doubts: but if he finde theſe markes, he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes cheerefully, becauſe, though the way bee tedious, yet he is in the right path. So the Croſſe is foretolde; if we meet with it, it confirmes vs; if not, it weakens vs.</p>
                  <p>But it may be ſome will ſay: Alas! I ſuffer nothing, I haue had ſmall or no troubles; no loſſes, ſickneſſe, &amp;c. For anſwere, know there is <hi>Abels</hi> croſſe, and <hi>Iſaaks</hi> croſſe: both theſe are perſecution: The Tongue of the wicked is perſecution (as <hi>Paul</hi> calls it,)

Beſides, this Earth to be without her ornaments, and to be naked and bare, were rather a defrauding then a reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Farther, I ſhould imagine, that Reſtoring ſhould haue reference to the ſtate it had before the fall: not when it was naked and voyd, but when it was in all it's beautie.</p>
                  <p>The firſt opinion to me alſo ſeemes as vnlikely as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: For the Scriptures, they may conueniently be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſpeake of the end of the World, by ſimilitude, &amp;c. and it is not probable that the Lord would Annihilate ſuch a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of his power. It is true, that the bodies of Chriſt and men will bee monuments of his power: but why not other alſo, ſeeing it pleaſed God to create variety of things for this end? Alſo, if theſe things ſhould bee reſolued into nothing, where ſhould the Diuels be, and the Reprobate? In Heauen they ſhall not bee; neither ſhall they bee no where, vnleſſe they hold alſo that they ſhall be annihilated, which is not by any meanes to be affirmed. Further, that place is againſt this opinion, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31.

<hi>Auguſtine</hi> likens Hope to an Egge, which ſaith hee is ſomewhat, but not a Bird: So Hope is ſomewhat, yea, a great matter, but not the enioying of the thing it ſelfe. We are as an Heire trauelling to take poſſeſſion of his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. We haue it not in poſſeſsion, but wee ſhall haue it ſo ſoone as we get home.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hope that is ſeene is not hope.</hi> Hope is not here taken for the Affection or Vertue, but for the Obiect, for the thing hoped for. So is Faith taken in that place of <hi>Paul.</hi>

                        <hi>Spes impertat motum animae in aliquod non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitum tendentem; Aquin. in loc.</hi>
                     </note> The thing hoped for, when it is ſeene, that is, poſſeſſed, ceaſes to be hoped for. For how can a man hope for that which hee ſeeth? We hold Saluation by Hope, therefore it is not preſent, but to come. For hope imparteth a motion of the minde, vnto a thing which we haue not.</p>
                  <p>From theſe is the Inference; containing an Exhortation Verſe 25. <hi>If we hope, &amp;c.</hi> then doe we, that is, we ought with patience to wait for it. We Hope for Saluation: It is abſent: It is therefore patiently to be expected, and all things to bee borne, which in the meane time ſhall fall out by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</p>
                  <p>Here then we haue foure things of Hope. 1. The Obiect of it: Things not ſeene. 2. The Effect of it: Saluation. 3. The Aſſurance of it: Wee are ſaued. 4. The Adiunct of it: Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is the gift of God, whereby, with a holy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and pleaſed minde we beare affliction, that wee may not loſe the thing hoped for.</p>

He can ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten theſe bitter waters. As the Apothecary of poiſon makes Triacle to driue out poiſon: So can God make the poiſon of afflictions, (which in themſelues are the curſe of the Law) to driue out the poiſon of ſinne. God makes afflictions worke to our good in two reſpects. 1. Of Sinne. 2. Of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of Sinne two wayes. Firſt, to preuent it. Secondly, to cure it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Phyſicion opens a veine not onely to cure, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times to preuent a diſeaſe: God knowes our diſpoſition. Hee ſees that many times wee are inclined to Pride, Vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Couetouſneſſe, Reuenge: Now that wee ſhould not fall into theſe, hee ſends vs loſſes in our goods, ſickneſſe in our bodies, &amp;c. whereby wee are kept and bridled from that which otherwiſe we would commit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sinne alſo is cured by afflictions. The bloud of Chriſt indeede hath onely this vertue: but afflictions are ſaid ſo to doe, becauſe they driue vs to ſeeke the cure, being therefore
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14442:62"/>called the medicine of the ſoule. They are of the beſt nature which are wonne by loue: but ten to one are brought to goodneſſe by afflictions.

                  <p>THe Apoſtle in the 28. Verſe affirmed; that Afflictions worke to the beſt good of Gods Children, becauſe God hath purpoſed to ſaue them: ſo that all things which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them by God, are ſubordinat means to bring this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to paſſe. As a man purpoſing to build a houſe, goes to the Forreſt, chooſeth Trees, fels them, hewes them, ſawes them, to make them fit for his building: So God purpoſing to ſaue vs, hewes off our knobs by affflictions, and prepares vs for glory.</p>
                  <p>That Reaſon, from the purpoſe of God, is here and in the next Verſe enlarged, from the inuiolable connexion of the Effects of it, which are the cauſes of our Saluation.</p>
                  <p>This Verſe expounds the former, the next Verſe expounds this.</p>
                  <p>In this is a definition of the purpoſe of God: namely, that it is a foreknowing of the Called.</p>
                  <p>The Principall propoſition in this Verſe, is this: Thoſe which are foreknowne, are predeſtinated to bee conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>In this propoſition we haue two things. 1. The Subiect:
<hi>Thoſe which he knew before.</hi> This Praecognition is not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or foreknowing of merit; but ſpeciall, ioyned with his loue; and indeed ſo it ſignifies here. Euen the loue of God, whereby from all Eternity he hath choſen vs in Chriſt vnto Saluation. This is called the good Pleaſure of Gods will!
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5.</note> Will is Purpoſe: Good pleaſure is this praecognition, or praeagnition.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing in the Propoſition is the Praedicate:
<hi>he predeſtinated to be conformed to the image of his Sonne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are two things. 1. The Act, he predeſtinated. 2. The Determination of the Act: to bee conformed, &amp;c. and this is amplified with a limitation in the laſt Clauſe of the Verſe. Of the which in the due place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He predeſtinated.</hi> To deſtinate is to appoint a thing to a <pb n="110" facs="tcp:14442:63"/>certaine end. To predeſtinate, is to appoint a thing to ſuch end before-hand. Predeſtination is by Diuines vſually taken and vſed in their writings, for the whole counſell of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Elect and Reprobate: and this they doe for plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſake. Here it is vſed onely for Election: neither doe I obſerue it otherwaies vſed in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>In Election we may conceiue two Acts. 1. A ſeparation of the choſen out of the Maſſe fallen. 2. An ordination of them to life, and the meanes of life. So is it taken here, as alſo in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places.

<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.49.</note> The meaning, to be like or conformable to Chriſt: that is, a Sonne, as hee is a Sonne: holy, as hee is holy: The which likeneſſe is either in this life, begunne: or in the life to come perfected.

                     <hi>He alſo called:</hi> In time, and out of their ſinfull eſtate, from the number of the wicked, outwardly by the Law, the Goſpell; which calling, is common to the Elect &amp; Reprobate.

                  <p>MAny are the troubles of the righteous. Therefore wee haue had many arguments of Conſolation; all which the Apoſtle here magnificently concludeth as with a ſong of <pb n="118" facs="tcp:14442:67"/>triumph, celebrating the
<hi>plerophory</hi> and confidence of the faithfull, founded vpon the immutable loue and counſell of God, ſhewing that no tentation is to be feared.</p>
                  <p>This concluſion <hi>Paul</hi> vtters after the manner of braue ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who when they ſee their enemies approch, ſhake their ſpeares, and waue their ſwords aboue their heads, as daring their foes: For hauing muſtered an armie of comforts and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, both againſt inbred corruption, and outward affliction; hee takes the field; daring hell it ſelfe to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with words of great defiance.

                  <p>Here then <hi>Paul</hi> renounceth all tentations and aſſaults, which might diſquiet the children of God: and this hee doth two wayes. 1. Generally, Verſe 31.2. Particularly: in the reſt.</p>
                  <p>In this 31. Verſe, are two things. 1. A queſtion. 2. An anſwere.</p>

It is true that this ought to follow; but this is not ſo proper. 2. That theſe ſhould bee the words of one amazed and ouercome, with the conſideration of Gods goodneſſe, not knowing how to expreſſe himſelfe. This comes neerer. 3.

                  <p>About the coherence moſt Interpreters iudge thus; that here is a proofe that God is with vs, becauſe he hath giuen vp his owne Sonne for vs: and then the argument is taken from the ſigne, not probable, but neceſſary and infallible. This is very true. Yet is may be very fitly conceiued thus. <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the Apoſtle doth anſwere an Obiection, which might <pb n="122" facs="tcp:14442:69"/>bee made from the Verſe going before.</p>
                  <p>If God bee for vs, ſaith the Fleſh. What meane then the want and pouerty whereby wee are preſſed? Pietie is hotly praiſed, but coldly rewarded. To this <hi>Paul</hi> anſwereth, as if he ſhould ſay: Let not ſuch diffidence diſtract you: God will freely giue you all things you neede: and this he proueth by an argument from the greater to the leſſe: Hee which giueth his owne Sonne, will deny nothing: and therefore the Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Tranſlator reades it, <hi>And if God hath not ſpared, &amp;c.</hi> which <hi>Beza</hi> moſt approues, and his Maieſties Tranſlation: <hi>Hee hath not ſpared.</hi> Not as before: Who hath not: implying that it ſhould be ſtill addreſt to anſwere to the queſtion, Verſe 31.</p>
                  <p>We are poore, ſaith the weake Chriſtian. I but if God hath giuen vs his owne Sonne, hee will deny vs nothing which is good for vs.</p>
                  <p>This Argument is amplified two wayes, 1. From a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Chriſt, who is here called Gods owne Sonne, that is,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.18.</note> his naturall, onely begotten. We are ſonnes, but adopted: and thus Chriſt alſo cals God his owne Father. Which terme notes equalitie, as the Iewes there vnderſtood.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. From an oppoſition of actions. <hi>Hee ſpared not, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered or gaue vp:</hi> It is more then if hee had ſaid, he gaue, though freely. For a man may giue of his abundance, but God hath not ſpared his owne and onely Sonne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But hath deliuered him vp,</hi> that is, to death.
<hi>Iudas</hi> deliuered him. So did God. <hi>Iudas</hi> as the Inſtrumentall, God as the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall cauſe, gouerning the Tradition of
<hi>Iudas:</hi> and yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is God to bee brought into the fellowſhip of the fault with <hi>Iudas;</hi> nor yet <hi>Iudas</hi> to be excuſed for the co-operation of God. Becauſe neither did God command or compell
<hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> to doe it; neither did <hi>Iudas</hi> in the doing of it, ayme at the pleaſing of God.</p>
                  <p>This action of GOD is amplified; from the Perſons for whom. For vs all: that is, not for all Men: but Beleeuers.</p>
                  <p>In theſe words then wee may conſider two things. 1. A Suppoſition, that GOD hath not ſpared his owne Sonne. 2. The Collection deduced and inferred. Hee will not deny vs any thing.</p>

                  <p>If thou beleeueſt, thou canſt want nothing which is good for thee: for all temporall bleſſings and ſpirituall, are annexed to the perſon of Chriſt, whom they poſſeſſe by Faith. Walke therefore cheerefully in thy calling, and be not anxious, nor diſquiet thy ſelfe with carking care.

                  <p>THat No Tribulation can ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt, is here proued, by the example of the ancient Church, recorded in the Scriptures; which comes in good ſeaſon: for leaſt ſuch grieuous things ſhould ſeeme ſignes of deſertion; hee brings a propheſie, which not only ſhewes that the Saints haue in former times ſuffered theſe things and been in fauour; but alſo that this ſhould bee the ſtate of the Church in this life.</p>
                  <p>This Propheſie or holy Teſtimonie is taken out of the 44.
<hi>Pſalme,</hi> Verſe 22. This Pſalme is intituled, A Pſalme of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to the ſonnes of <hi>Corah,</hi> which ſome interpret to the ſonnes of Martyrdome. It is queſtioned, when, and vpon what occaſion this Pſalme was written. Some thinke vpon occaſion of the 70. yeeres captiuitie at Babylon. But this is vncertaine, Becauſe That Captiuitie was a puniſhment for their ſinnes: It was not For thy ſake all the day long. It is more likely, to my ſeeming, to be vpon the occaſion of the horrible perſecution of the Church vnder <hi>Antiochus Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> vnto which in all likelihood <hi>Paul</hi> hath reference, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. toward the latter end.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme is this; The Saints of old haue endured Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation vnto death: and yet were not ſeparated from the loue of God: Therefore ſuch tribulation cannot ſeparate vs Now. That they haue endured, the Records of all times teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie: and that their ſufferings extinguiſhed not the ſenſe of Gods loue, appeares, becauſe they endured for Gods ſake; which they could not haue done without an exceeding ſenſe of his loue. Neither can ſuch things ſeparate, becauſe of the conſtant decree, true from <hi>Abel.</hi> They which will liue godly, muſt ſuffer perſecution: And through many tribulations we muſt enter into the Kingdome of Heauen.</p>
                  <p>In this report of the ſufferings of the ancient Church, we haue three things. 1. The greatneſſe of their ſufferings. <hi>They</hi>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:14442:76"/>
                     <hi>were killed:</hi> amplified by a ſimilitude, <hi>As ſheepe to the ſlaughter.</hi> 2. The cauſe; Not for Their Sinne, but
<hi>for Thy ſake.</hi> 3. The continuance, how long? Euen <hi>all the day long.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We are killed:</hi> Not mortified, as the Vulgar, which
<hi>Sarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> followes, expounding of the killing of ſinne: namely, that all our Afflictions muſt tend to mortification, that there may be an end of ſinning, before there bee an end of liuing: but it is to be vnderſtood of bodily death, which is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of troubles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All the day long:</hi> A day is a meaſure of time, which is either taken for the whole time of the world, from <hi>Abel</hi> to the laſt Martyr; or for the time of euery Chriſtians life, beginning at his conuerſion; This is the beſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> But how can one be killed all the day long? A man can be killed but once, and it requires not a day, nor an houre for it: our life is taken away in a moment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is to be vnderſtood either of euery affliction, which is <hi>mors partialis,</hi> a kinde of death, and a paſſing vnto it; or in regard of our continual danger and readineſſe to die, with the terror of it: being neuer ſecure, but alwaies expecting to be taken and killed, which is more terrible then Death it ſelfe. When we muſt die, it is a fauour ſuddenly to be diſpatcht; by nature all die but once, but by our willingnes we may ſuffer it euery day, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.31</note> 
                     <hi>he died daily.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And are counted as ſheepe to the ſlaughter:</hi> Not innocent, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ready to heare and follow Chriſts voice, as elſewhere the terme ſheepe is taken. The enemies of the Goſpell doe not ſo reckon of vs; but here it is meant as in that ſaying of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,

                     <hi>I ſend you as ſheepe among wolues.</hi> Therefore called ſheepe of the ſlaughter: That is, Tyrants make no more rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of the taking away of our liues, then a Butcher doth of cutting the throat of a ſheepe. Some ſheep are good for ſtore, ſome for ſlaughter: we are not counted for ſtore: Happy were it if here were alwaies ſtore of beleeuers, their liues would much profit the world.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gene.</hi> 18.</note> If there had been found in Sodom ten ſuch ſtore-Chriſtians, it might haue ſtood to this day: but the world vſeth not to ſpare ſuch; but as a Butcher kills a ſheep, without making conſcience of the effuſion of the blood of it:
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:14442:76"/>nay, hee thinks well of his worke, and is glad when hee hath done it: So Chriſt ſaith, that Tyrants ſhall kill Chriſtians, and thinke that thereby they haue done good ſeruice to God.</p>

                  <p>IN theſe Verſes the third tentation is remoued, which is from the euill ſuppoſed to be in God; which is mutabilitie of his loue, and it is brought in as anſwering a doubt.</p>

                     <hi>Paul</hi> confidently anſweres, that not onely no tribulation as before; but no creature or thing that is or may bee preſent or to come; no Wit, Power, or Policy; no Men, Diuels, Angels, if they were all muſtered in one armie, could ſeparate Gods children, from his loue vnto them in Chriſt Ieſus.

                  <p>In theſe words are two parts. 1. A Propoſition, That No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſeparate vs from Gods loue. 2.

                     <item>If none be iuſtified but by faith in Chriſt, then the Iewes are not iuſtified, but in the ſtate of condemnation: for they hate Chriſt, haue crucified him, and perſecute ſuch as belieue in him.</item>

               <p>Secondly, No people vnder the Sunne are ſo zealous of righteouſneſſe; which their righteouſneſſe and zeale that it ſhould be of no reckoning, and the Gentiles that neuer inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Law, to be receiued for their faith in Chriſt; ſeemes contrary to Reaſon and Iuſtice.</p>

               <p>For anſwere to the Argument, the Minor is to be denied. For it is not abſurd to affirme but the truth; that the Iewes, becauſe they beleeue not in Chriſt, are not Iuſtified.

                  <p>IN this nynth Chapter <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewes, that though the Iewes be reiected, yet the promiſe failes not; which was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally neuer meant to any vnbelieuing, either Iewe or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile. And therfore he expounds the promiſe made to the Iews: vpon that occaſion falling into the doctrine of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, &amp; of the reiection of the Iewes, &amp; calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> before he enters into, he premiſeth a Preface to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the minds of the Iews to the patient reading of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>So that in this Chapter are two parts. 1. A Preface in the fiue firſt verſes. 2. The Treatiſe it ſelfe, concerning the ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the promiſe of God, notwithſtanding the caſting off of the Iewes.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe it was odious to the Iewes to heare of their reiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that the Gentiles ſhould bee admitted to fauour: Therefore
<hi>Paul</hi> in the Preface proteſteth ſolemnely both of his loue to his Nation, and exceeding hearts griefe for their Reprobation, that it might appeare theſe things to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken not of malice and ſpleene, as they were ready to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, but of conſcience towards God and his Truth, which was his office to deliuer.</p>
                  <p>In the Generall, from this Preface a note may be obſerued for Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1.</note> Miniſters are to ſpeake the Truth though it diſpleaſe: yet with ſobriety of wiſedome after the example of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo as we may, if it be poſſible, with gentle and louing means, winne the affections of the Auditors both to vs, and our doctrine.</p>
                  <p>In this, two ſorts of Miniſters much faile: Firſt, thoſe which are ſo tender &amp; ſtudious to pleaſe, that they are loth to ſpeake any but ſweet words, though men rot in their ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thoſe which are as farre on the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, accounting all prefacing and louing ſpeaking to bee dawbing, and no ſentence to be zealouſly deliuered, vnleſſe <pb n="152" facs="tcp:14442:84"/>Damnation and Damned be at the end of it: vvhereby many times, they driue them farther from Chriſt, whom they would haue conuerted vnto him. Let ſuch imitate <hi>Pauls</hi> diſcretion here, who might haue been rough with theſe ſtubborne and obſtinate Iewes, and haue ſpoken hardly to them, being ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Perſecutors of Chriſt and his members: but hee chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth rather to ſpeake mildly, as beeing likely to doe more good. So he aduiſed
<hi>Timothy:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24.25</note> The ſeruant of Chriſt (ſaith he) muſt be gentle towards all men, euen euill men, inſtructing them with meeknes. So he practiſed himſelfe, with his kind words, ſo inſinuating into King <hi>Agrippa</hi> his affections, that he had almoſt perſwaded him to be a Chriſtian:

                        <hi>Acts</hi> 26.28.</note> when rough words might haue much exaſperated his mind.</p>

Or out of a pride and preſumption of their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe aboue others, All preaching which is not declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and inuectiue againſt ſinne, is cold preaching vvith them.</p>
                  <p>Pray for thy Teacher, and be content to heare thy ſinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued; and aboue all, deſire to heare of Chriſt Ieſus, and the mercy of God in him, the next and immediate cauſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting a ſinner.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme of the Preface in the fiue firſt verſes, is a prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of his loue, manifeſted by his exceeding griefe for their Reiection. Or a proteſtation of his griefe, iſſuing from his loue.</p>
                  <p>In it there are two parts. 1. A Complaint. 2. A Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. The Complaint is in the ſecond verſe, firſt to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The Iuſtification, ver. 1. 3. 4. 5.</p>

                  <p>The greatnes is ſet forth three wayes. 1. By a Compariſon expreſſed in a vvord, ſignifying the paines and ſorrow of a vvoman in trauell<note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>The Cauſe is not expreſſed for the horror of the thing: his minde trembled to name it: and it would haue beene full of Enuy. But it is eaſily gathered out of the matter following; namely, for the Reiection and Reprobation of the Iewes.</p>

<hi>Beth</hi> ſometime in the Hebrue, ſo <hi>En</hi> in the Greeke, is the token of an Oath in this place;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Piſcator.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi>
12.2.</note> and ſo alſo ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound that of <hi>Paul.</hi> I know a man in Chriſt: that is, By <pb n="156" facs="tcp:14442:86"/>Chriſt: yet not by Chriſt as onely a man, but as God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I lye not:</hi> This duplication of contraries, is here, as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, vſed for the more force, and to ſhew his ſyncerity. For a man may lye, and yet ſpeake the truth; as when hee addes a lye vnto the truth: And therefore it is well prouided by our godly Lawes, that men to giue in euidence, are ſworne to ſpeake the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. <hi>Paul</hi> in this Affirmation and Negation, frees himſelfe from this.</p>
                  <p>Againe, a man may lye in ſpeaking the Truth: For our ſpeech hath Relation either to the minde, or to the thing. If it agree with the thing, and not with the minde, it is a lye, for that properly makes a lye. If it agree with the minde, and not with the thing, it is falſe, but no lye: and therefore becauſe we diſcerne not mens mindes, we muſt be warie how wee giue any the lye. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore for the more credit of his oath, and that all exceptions of ambiguitie, mentall reſeruation, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocation might be taken away, hee put his oath Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, and Negatiuely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My conſcience bearing mee witneſſe: Paul</hi> here neither ſweares by his Conſcience, nor by the holy Spirit, though this might bee iuſtified: but hee iuſtifies his oath by the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Conſcience. For Conſcience is a thouſand wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, being for this purpoſe placed in man by God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the holy Ghoſt:</hi> That is, renued by the Holy Ghoſt: ſo that <hi>Paul</hi> could ſpeak in no words with more weight, againſt all exceptions then he vſeth here.</p>
                  <p>Firſt he auoucheth it the truth which he deliuers: <hi>I ſpeake the truth;</hi> and becauſe no Iew ſhould cauill that part may be truth, and part a lye; He addes, <hi>I lye not:</hi> and becauſe his word it may be would beare no pawne, He addes an Oath: And becauſe the Oath of an vnconſcionable man is little worth, he brings in his Conſcience; and becauſe vnleſſe the Conſcience bee enlightned and directed, it may erre; therefore hee ſignifies that his Conſcience is renued by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>So we haue here two things. 1. <hi>Pauls</hi> Oath. <hi>I ſpeake the truth in Chriſt, I lye not:</hi> 2. The auouchment of his Oath:
<hi>My Conſcience bearing me witneſſe in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> I might
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:14442:86"/>here enter into the common place of Truth, Lying, Oath, Conſcience; but I write a briefe Commentarie, not a volume, of Common places.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in <hi>Pauls</hi> Oath wee haue three things. Firſt, the Perſon that makes Oath: <hi>Paul.</hi> Secondly, the Perſon by whom the Oath is made: <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Thirdly, the Cauſe, which is a matter of weight and great conſequence; namely; that <hi>Paul</hi> writes not in <hi>malice,</hi> but in <hi>loue,</hi> and that hee grieues for the Reiection of his Nation.</p>

                  <p>IN this Verſe is a ſecond Argument, to proue
<hi>Pauls</hi> griefe for the reiection of the Jewes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I could wiſh my ſelfe:</hi> By the duplication of the Pronoune, <hi>Paul</hi> moſt ſignificantly expreſſeth himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To be accurſed,</hi> or ſeparated <hi>from Chriſt:</hi> There are diuers impertinent expoſitions, which I leaue. The word here vſed, ſignifieth that which is put apart from the vſe of man, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated vnto God, not after an ordinary manner, as ſuch things which might be redeemed; but with the accurſing of them who ſhould conuert it to their owne vſe; and ſo by a tranſlated ſenſe it ſignifieth a perpetuall ſeparation from Chriſt. As therefore ſuch things were ſeparated from men for honour ſake: ſo applyed to men, it ſignifies to be ſeparate from Chriſt for horror ſake. This is
<hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> expoſition, approued of the beſt Interpreters. And as the Greeke word is thus vſed; ſo, <hi>Sacer</hi> properly ſignifying Holy, is vſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Latines by good Authors<note n="g" place="margin">
                        <hi>Auri ſacra fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.</hi> Virg. <hi>Sacer inteſtabilis eſto.</hi> Hor.</note>, in a contrary ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For my brethren</hi> (not ſpirituall) but <hi>kinſmen according to the fleſh,</hi> that is, the Iewes, as if he had ſaid, I would bee damned in their ſtead, that they might be wonne to Chriſt and ſaued in mine. As <hi>Dauid</hi> wiſhed he might haue dyed for <hi>Abſolon:</hi> and Chriſt dyed for vs.</p>
                  <p>The Argument to iuſtifie <hi>Pauls</hi> griefe, is from an effect of <pb n="161" facs="tcp:14442:88"/>his loue, which is a conteſtation that for their ſakes he would with all his heart be accurſed from Chriſt. Therefore he muſt needs be grieued for their ſeparation.</p>
                  <p>This loue of <hi>Paul</hi> is here amplified by three circumſtances. 1. The Perſon wiſhing, <hi>Paul.</hi> 2. The matter of his wiſh, <hi>to be accurſed from Chriſt.</hi> 3. For whoſe ſake; for the Iewes. Who? <hi>Paul?</hi> who was ſo zealous for Chriſt? To be accurſed from Chriſt, his onely Ioy and Deſire? and for the Iewes his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? who layd continuall wayt for him? about a fortie of them vowing neither to eate nor drinke till they had his bloud? Euen thus it was; Euen <hi>Paul</hi> wiſheth to be accurſed from Chriſt, for theſe. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> calls it a flame, a ſea of loue. No ſea ſo deepe, no flame ſo bright as
<hi>Pauls</hi> loue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> But is it lawfull for <hi>Paul</hi> thus to wiſh? For it is to bee holden as a truth in Diuinitie, that euery man is firſt to haue a care of his owne ſoule: yea, the Papiſts affirme, that though the ſoule of the Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> (whom they too much adore) were in perill, yet for her ſaluation wee ought not to hazard our owne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> There are many farre-fetcht anſweres: For Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue exceedingly laboured herein. Wee hardly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how this ſhould be, becauſe we are farre from the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>Pauls</hi> loue.</p>
                  <p>Among all the Anſwers: there are 3. principall. The firſt is, that <hi>Paul</hi> vſeth an Hyperbolicall ſpeech, or that hee ſpake haſtily, not well conſidering the matter: but hee ſpake vpon his oath, as we haue heard: and therefore no Hyperbole or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſight to be admitted.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, that he did not indeed ſo wiſh, but was ready ſo to doe, if it were lawfull: but the words, and his oath take away this alſo: he did actually ſo wiſh, and without ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                  <p>The third is <hi>Chryſoſtomes,</hi> which alſo
<hi>Aquinas</hi> hath: who make a double ſeparation from Chriſt. 1. To be ſeparated from his loue; which <hi>Paul</hi> by no meanes wiſheth: neither is it lawfull to deſire either not to loue Chriſt, or not to bee belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of him. 2. To be ſeparated from him onely by puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in regard of the fruition of heauenly ioyes; and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> 
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:14442:89"/>wiſhes here, not ſo much hauing an eye to the deſtruction of the Iewes, as to the glory of Chriſt. The vnbeleeuing Iewes did daily by vile ſpeeches blaſpheme Chriſt; the hearing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was ſo grieuous to
<hi>Paul,</hi> that out of a great zeale he wiſhed verily to haue beene accurſed from Chriſt, rather then that he ſhould be ſo reuiled: yet ſo accurſed, as that he would ſtill loue Chriſt, and be beloued of him. He will for no cauſe be depriued of Chriſts loue; but he is content to loſe his part in Heauen for Chriſts glory.</p>

                  <p>THe Iewes did thus argue (as we haue ſeen) that if they be Reprobated; then the word of Promiſe takes no effect. The contrary whereof
<hi>Paul</hi> auouched in the firſt part of the ſixt verſe.</p>
                  <p>Here <hi>Paul</hi> proues that which hee auouched; In which proofe hee takes away the ground on which the Iewes did inſiſt.</p>
                  <p>Their ground was this: that the Promiſe was made to
<hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeede, and to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and his ſeede: which ſeede they affirmed themſelues to bee, and from hence ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued thus.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeede is the Promiſe made.</p>
                  <p>But we are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed: therefore the promiſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin, and Eternall life, muſt be performed to vs, and if it be not, then doth God faile of his promiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers to this Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, by a diſtinction of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to whom the promiſe was made; which ſubiect is the ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> is of two ſorts. Carnall, to which the promiſe is not made: and Spirituall, to which it was made. The error of the Iewes was, that they made the Promiſe too generall; counting all that deſcended of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> by a carnall generation, to be that ſeed to which the promiſes ſhould belong. But
<hi>Paul</hi> ſhewes, that the promiſe was neuer meant to all that come of
<hi>Abraham</hi> by the fleſh, but to the ſpirituall ſeed, which were the children of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
                  <p>So that there are two parts of <hi>Pauls</hi> anſwer. In the firſt part he ſheweth, that the promiſe is not meant to all them vvhich
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14442:93"/>are Iſraelites according to the fleſh. In theſe verſes, and ſo to the 24. The ſecond, that it is meant to the elect of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, from the 24. verſe to the end of the chapter.</p>
                  <p>In this firſt part of <hi>Pauls</hi> anſwere, he ſhewes, that though many of the Iewes be caſt away, yet the promiſe is not made void; becauſe the promiſe was neuer meant to all the Iewes, thus:
<list type="syllogism">
                        <item>If all were the Iſraelites to whom the promiſe is made, then if all that deſcend of Iſrael, were not ſaued, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe failed: But all that deſcend of Iſrael, are not that Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, to whom the promiſes were made, verſe 6. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</item>

                  <p>The Minor is proued by a double inſtance: the firſt, of
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> children; the ſecond, of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and
<hi>Rebeccaes</hi> children.</p>
                  <p>The firſt inſtance is in the 7.8.9. verſes. The ſecond, in the 10.11.12.13. verſes. In the firſt inſtance are two things: the Propoſition, verſ. 7. the ſumme whereof is, that though the tenor of the promiſe be to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed, yet that ſeed is determined in <hi>Iſaac:</hi> ſo that all that are the carnall ſeed of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> are not children: that is, of God, or of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. For
<hi>Iſmael</hi> and his poſterity were excluded.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The expoſition, v. 8. confirmed, by a teſtimony, ver. 9. <hi>They which are the children of the fleſh:</hi> that is, of the fleſh of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> onely, according to the courſe of nature, are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the children of God, but thoſe which are the children of the promiſe, according to the word of promiſe, are accounted for the ſeed to whom the promiſes are made. Plainely, it is thus to be conceiued.
<hi>Abraham</hi> hath diuers ſonnes, <hi>Iſmael, Iſaac, Zimram, Iocktan, Medan,</hi> &amp;c. The promiſe is made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed: As if you ſhould ſay, to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his heires; not meaning euery ſonne, but the heires being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by God, namely <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and all ſuch which are after the manner of <hi>Iſaac:</hi> the ſeed being to be expounded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to the children of promiſe, and extended no farther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What is meant by the children of promiſe, and vvho are they?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. Iſaac</hi> was a child of promiſe, in this regard, becauſe hee was begotten not by the force of Nature, but by the force of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14442:93"/>the promiſe, <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sara</hi> being then ſo old, that it was as poſſible for <hi>Abraham</hi> to haue a child by <hi>Sara,</hi> in nature, as for a ſtone to flie. So that all thoſe which are after the maner of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> are children of promiſe, as is plaine, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> is the Father of the faithfull, not onely becauſe he is an enſample to the faithful, but by belieuing the promiſe of the birth of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> For by that faith, he not onely begat the promiſed <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but all other Beleeuers, which were compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the promiſe which <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeued: <hi>Iſaac</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a type of all Beleeuers both Iewes and Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme then is, that all they which are after the manner of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> are the ſeed or children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that ſhall be bleſſed with him.</p>

                     <hi>Eſau</hi> is diſherited, and yet God gaue a lawe that the firſt borne ſhould not be depriued of his birthright, namely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iuſt &amp; weighty cauſe. Hence <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> makes a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether God can diſpenſe with his owne Lawes. With the Iudiciall and Ceremoniall no doubt he may. Concerning the Morall: It is by ſome anſwered that he may, and that the Commandements are to be vnderſtood with this prouiſo, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe God command otherwiſe, for the Law is for vs, not for God. But this anſwer ſeemes to be defectiue: becauſe the Law being the copy of Gods Will, muſt needes bee an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, and vnvarying rule of righteouſnes. God is a law to himſelfe by the perfection of his nature, which he hath expreſſed in his Law: and therefore to command any thing <pb n="175" facs="tcp:14442:95"/>contrary to his law, or to diſpenſe with it, ſo that the things here forbidden, as theft, whoredome, &amp;c. ſhould be no ſins, in the ſence they are forbidden, ſeemes to be as though God ſhould depart from his owne nature, which is impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pareus</hi> a very learned man anſwers otherwiſe, namely,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>In orat. paraen. de legum dignitate, vſu, &amp; obedienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a, ex</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.8,9.</note> that the Law indeed is an immoueable rule euen in regard of God, not ſimply in regard of the whole Decalogue, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to ſome part of it. And therefore he diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth of the Commandements: holding ſome abſolutely to proceed from the Nature of God, which he doth freely &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily will, as <hi>Command.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 7, 9. The reſt as 4, 5, 6, 8, 10. to proceed from the will of God, but not neceſſarily. The things in theſe laſt to be iuſt or vniuſt, becauſe commanded or forbidden, and that in theſe lyes that Prouiſo, Till God command otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>But with reuerence of that Worthy man, I cannot vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, how at any time, it ſhould be no ſinne to ſteale or to murder, in the ſenſe it is forbidden in the law. My opinion is, that the Iuſtice in theſe Lawes proceeds from the pure nature of God, and are neceſſarily therefore willed by him, as well as the Iuſtice in the other precepts. My reaſon is, becauſe the equity of theſe lawes is imprinted in our nature: and that which is imprinted thus in our nature, is a remnant of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, which was according to the naturall and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Iuſtice of God.</p>
                  <p>The Schoolemen therfore (as I take it) more ſafely reſolue this doubt, who hold that God (ſauing his Iuſtice) cannot command that which is contrary to his law, as that a man ſhould ſteale, &amp;c. and yet not ſinne. And therefore whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it ſeemes that God hath commanded the contrary, wee are to know, that the matter of the precept is varied. As the Iſraelites rob the Egyptians, yet not guilty of theft, becauſe when the Iſraelites tooke thoſe goods, they were not the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, but their owne, giuen to them by God, who hath right and authoritie to beſtowe thoſe things where and to whome he pleaſeth. All things forbidden in the morall law, are ſinnes, not onely becauſe they are there forbidden, but principally, becauſe they are contrarie to the moſt iuſt nature <pb n="176" facs="tcp:14442:96"/>and will of God, of which the law is a copie.</p>

                  <p>IN this Verſe is the Amplification of the ſecond Inſtance. The ſumme of the Inſtance was, that though <hi>Eſau</hi> and
<hi>Iacob</hi> were Twinnes, and <hi>Eſau</hi> the firſt borne, yet the promiſe made to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and his ſeed, was not to be vnderſtood of <hi>Eſau,</hi> but of <hi>Iacob,</hi> being ſo determined by God. So that there is a great difference betweene theſe two Twinnes.</p>
                  <p>Of which difference here are two things declared: Firſt, the Time. Secondly, the Cauſe. The Time, in theſe words, <hi>The Children being not yet borne, neither hauing done any good or ill.</hi>

                  <p>Here the time hath a double relation: firſt, to their birth. Secondly, to their actions, or conuerſation. When they had done neither good nor euiill, that is, actually, for when the Oracle came to <hi>Rebecca,</hi> they were originally guilty before God.</p>

                  <p>But theſe are toyes and Impoſtures, and confuted by this example. For a man is appointed of GOD before hee is borne: Therefore his eſtate depends not on his Natiuitie. There could bee no greater diuerſitie in any then betweene <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau;</hi> and yet Twinnes, and borne at the ſame time and in the ſame place, and therefore why not vnder the ſame Conſtellation? For <hi>Iacob</hi> held <hi>Eſau</hi> by the heele, and both were but as a long child. If they ſay that the Motion of the heauens is ſo ſwift, that notwithſtanding they might be born vnder diuers Aſcendents: I would aske, If ſo ſwift? How can they diſcerne it? And (with <hi>Gregory</hi>) then euery one is borne vnder diuers Conſtellations, as his head vnder one, his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders vnder another, his belly vnder a third, his legges vnder a fourth.

                  <p>Now followes the Cauſe of ſuch difference betweene
<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi> and <hi>Iacob;</hi> that one ſhould be loued, and the other hated.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſe is the ſtabilitie of the purpoſe of Gods Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>That the purpoſe of God according to Election, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>In the words is a Traiection of the Verbe, which if it bee right placed, maketh the ſenſe plaine, which otherwiſe is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure. For the ſenſe they would bee thus placed: That the purpoſe of God concerning Election, which is not of works, but of him that calleth, might ſtand, that is, might bee <pb n="178" facs="tcp:14442:97"/>firme. This purpoſe here mentioned, to bee vnderſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Reprobation, as well as about Election, as included in the contrary.</p>
                  <p>The meaning then is, that God manifeſted to <hi>Rebecca</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her children were borne, their different eſtates, cauſed by the ſtable Decree of God, which depends not vpon the workes of man, but vpon the Will of God.</p>
                  <p>Here we haue three things.

                  <p>This confuteth the Ieſuites, among whom this is the moſt receiued opinion, that the praeſcience of the co-operation of our Free-will with Grace, and of our finall perſeuerance, is the cauſe of Election. This co-operation, they ſay, is reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not by the way of ſimple vnderſtanding, as poſſible, but by the way of viſion, as abſolutely and actually to be. Which viſion or fore-ſight of our actuall co-operation with grace, is the cauſe of Election, and in order of reaſon (as they affirme) goes before it; which is nothing elſe, but that the goodnes of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:14442:98"/>our owne wils, is the cauſe why God elects vs. This opinion comes neere to <hi>Pelagius,</hi> but is farre from <hi>Paul,</hi> who affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the purpoſe of God concerning Election, to bee of him that calleth.</p>
                  <p>This alſo confuteth thoſe, who hold that Faith foreſeene is a condition prae-requiſite, or a motiue cauſe to Election: moſt contrarie to this of the Apoſtle here, who affirmeth that <hi>Iacob</hi> was elected, before hee had done any workes; that Election might be not of Workes, but of him that calleth. <hi>Arminius</hi> expounds theſe words (of him that calleth) thus:

                     </note> that the purpoſe of Gods election might bee not of workes, but of Faith, whereby it is obeyed to him that calleth. This Gloſſe corrupteth the Text; and is like an old piece, ſowne to a new garment: For firſt, this quite croſſeth the meaning of the words, and in effect it ſhould be thus, not of workes, but of him that is called; for they alſo abſurdly hold that Faith is of our ſelues. Secondly, when there is an oppoſition betweene Faith and Workes, it is in the point of Iuſtification: and Faith not oppoſed in regard of it ſelfe, but of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt by it apprehended: as it is a vertue, it comes vnder the account of workes, which in as much as they hold, there muſt needs follow a confuſion in the ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Gods election is without Faith, as the cauſe of it: not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, as the meanes appointed to Iuſtification and ſaluation. <hi>So alſo Reprobation is without ſinne, as the cauſe diſcretiue impelling:</hi> not without it, as a condition, without the which God repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bateth not: as for inſtance: God conſiders <hi>Eſau</hi> &amp;
<hi>Iacob</hi> falne in <hi>Adam.</hi> His authoritie and power is this. Hee may ſaue both: and he may damne both, and that iuſtly if hee will.

                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:14442:99"/>The foundation is in God: The markes in vs. God hath not reuealed to men whether they bee Elect or Reprobate. 'Tis not written in euery ones forehead: but this is written in the Word,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10.</note> that we muſt make our election ſure, not in it ſelfe, but in our aſſured knowledge of it: which may be done <hi>à po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriori,</hi> as they ſay, that is, by certain effects of election, which are infallible markes of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>There are two ſpeciall markes of election noted by Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. Faith: and Repentance. If thou haſt Faith, thou art Elect: for only ſuch beleeue which are ordained to life. Repentance alſo approues thy election. For we are elected that we ſhould be holy, and God hath ordained vs to walke in good workes, and to be clothed with righteouſneſſe, and the obedience of a new life.</p>
                  <p>If thou ſayeſt, Alas, what ſhall I doe? I finde not theſe markes in me: but the contrarie: as Ignorance, Contempt of the Word, Profaneneſſe, Whoredome, Pride, Drunkenneſſe, &amp;c. I anſwere thee, Yet deſpaire not: but vſe the meanes, and ſubmit thy ſelfe to them: and if thou beeſt elect, they ſhall become effectuall to worke in thee all ſuch graces vnto life. Some as Spiders gather poiſon out of this hony. Either of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or (as I would rather iudge) of Ignorance, blaſpheming this Doctrine and ſaying: If there be Predeſtination, and ſo certaine; then let vs neuer trouble our ſelues about Faith and Repentance: For if I be predeſtinated to bee ſaued, my ſinnes cannot damne mee, if to bee damned, my care cannot ſaue mee.</p>
                  <p>To affirm this, is horrible blaſphemy, for it is in effect to ſay, that God, who hath giuen vs his word, to teach vs to liue wel, hath therein opened to vs a Doctrine of careleſſeneſſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſſe. Which is to deny the wiſedome and purity of God.</p>
                  <p>Alſo they conſider not, that by the ſame act, God both predeſtinates a man to life, and to the meanes of obtaining it, which are Faith and Repentance, without which he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated to ſaue none.</p>
                  <p>A man hath a grieuous wound: will he ſay, if God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it ſhall heale, It will heale, though I vſe no playſter?
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:14442:99"/>Will a man neglect to eat, becauſe God hath appointed how long he ſhall liue? Did <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſo for the terme of thoſe fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeeres, becauſe of Gods appointment? Will a man on the top of an houſe refuſe the ordinary meanes of ſafety, and leape down vpon theſe termes? Will we not on theſe termes truſt our bodies, and ſhal we our ſoules? In bodily things will wee ioyne the meanes and end together, whatſoeuer Gods predeſtination be, and ſhall we not in ſpirituall, which are of much more weight?</p>
                  <p>A child is ſure of the inheritance, by vertue of ſome entayle, neither can his father put him by it. Will hee therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne his father, and ſpit in his face? Surely the children of God will not, becauſe of their aſſurance, be deſperate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, but ſo much the more carefull to pleaſe God.</p>

                     <hi>Abraham, Dauid, Samuel,</hi> &amp;c. neuer argued thus: neuer any godly man reaſoned after this manner: this is the Logike of irreligious and profane wretches. It muſt needs be an euill way wherein none but lewd beaſts walke.</p>
                  <p>Whereas ſome thinke that this doctrine alſo annihilates preaching: I anſwere that the end of preaching is not to make of Reprobates Elect; but that the Elect therby ſhould attaine the fore-purpoſed, and promiſed ſaluation.</p>

                  <p>IN theſe Verſes, and ſo to the end of the 18.
<hi>Paul</hi> anſweres an obiection, which fleſh and bloud make againſt the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God with <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> and with the Elect and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, which hath before beene auouched.</p>
                  <p>Here are two parts. Firſt, the obiection, verſe 14. Secondly, the anſwere, in the end of the 14. verſe, and in the 15. and
16.</p>
                  <p>The obiection challengeth God of iniuſtice; after this
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:14442:100"/>manner. If it bee ſo, that men are elected or reprobated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are borne, and when they haue done neither good or euill, onely according to the will of God: Then God is vniuſt. But God is not vniuſt: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The full meaning of this obiection will the better appeare, if wee hit aright, againſt what the obiection is layd. Maſter <hi>Beza</hi> thinketh that God is by fleſh and bloud challenged of iniuſtice, if he proceede to election or reprobation, before men liue in the world, and manifeſt their deſerts: Conceiuing that GOD in Iuſtice ſhould ſtay his decreeing of men, till they be borne, and by their life haue manifeſted their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or illneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Others, and the moſt are of minde, that the obiection ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from Gods vnequall dealing with equals: <hi>Iacob</hi> &amp;
<hi>Eſau</hi> are equall in birth, in corruption, &amp;c. neither hauing deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued better or worſe then other, yet God loueth the one, and hateth the other. At this fleſh and bloud ſtumbleth, complaining of iniuſtice, and acception of perſons. For a iuſt Iudge dealeth iuſtly, when he dealeth alike, with like Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors: either then let them be both elected, or both repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, both ſaued, or both damned.</p>
                  <p>The firſt opinion raiſeth the obiection from the time of the Decree. This from the Perſons about whom the Decree is. I approue this to bee the beſt, vpon a reaſon taken out of <hi>Pauls</hi> anſwere, verſe
15. the which is applyed to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, not to the Time. For if the obiection lay from the time, <hi>Paul</hi> would and ſhould haue anſwered, I will haue mercy, when I will haue mercy, and not, vpon whom.</p>
                  <p>The anſwere vnto this Obiection is two-fold: 1. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
2. Speciall.

The Syriake Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator reades it, God forgiue, noting thereby the hainouſnes of ſuch thoughts.</p>
                  <p>The ſpeciall anſwere is <hi>verſe</hi> 15.16,17,18. and hath two <pb n="185" facs="tcp:14442:100"/>parts. The firſt, prouing God is not vniuſt in electing, <hi>verſe</hi> 15, 16. The ſecond, that he is not vniuſt in reprobating, <hi>verſe</hi> 17, 18.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt, are two parts. The firſt, an Authoritie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that GOD is not vniuſt in electing, <hi>verſe</hi> 15. The ſecond, a Determination of the point, <hi>verſe</hi> 16. according to the truth of <hi>verſe</hi> 11. The Authoritie which <hi>Paul</hi> vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is taken out of <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. &amp; is the ſpeech of God to
<hi>Moſes,</hi> either of the people rendring the reaſon why all that were guiltie of the Calfe were not handled alike, but ſome puniſhed, other ſpared: or of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſelfe, when hee ſhewed him his glory, declaring it to bee not for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his merit, but of his owne mercy: which way ſoeuer you take it, the Queſtion is, wherein the force of the reaſon ſhould be, to proue that God is not vniuſt in. Election and Reprobation.</p>
                  <p>Interpreters ſay generally thus: It is mercy to bee elected, not Iuſtice: therefore God is not vniuſt, becauſe mercy vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates no Iuſtice, but iniuſtice, as contrary vnto it. The force of the argument is put in Mercy: but I take it, that it is better, and more plainely to be vnderſtood, if it be put in Iuſtice, or rather the authoritie of God.</p>
                  <p>For the vnderſtanding whereof, obſerue, that Iuſtice is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken two wayes. Either generally for the whole company of vertues, and ſo it is the Rectitude and Perfection of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Nature, or ſpecially for that which giues <hi>Suum Cui<expan>

In the firſt; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticall, of Quantitie. In the ſecond; Geometricall; of Proportion.</p>
                  <p>Commutatiue Iuſtice is not in God, in as much as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſts in equalitie of giuing and taking. But none giue to God equall things, according to that they take; as a penny for a penyworth.</p>
                  <p>Neither is Diſtributiue Iuſtice properly in God, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſimilitude. For he giueth to his creatures what he thinketh good, not according to their merite, but according to his owne pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:14442:101"/>Now this giuing, according to this iuſtice, is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in God, either as he is God, or a Iudge, or a Lord.</p>

                  <p>As a Iudge of all; and ſo he puniſheth the wicked, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth the godly.</p>
                  <p>As a Lord; and ſo he will haue this to liue, and that to die: among men corrupt alike; this man to be choſen, that man to be reprobated; and in this laſt acception it is to be taken here. And ſo the force of the Argument lyeth in theſe words: <hi>On whom hee will.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I will haue mercy vpon <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and not vpon
<hi>Eſau,</hi> becauſe it ſo pleaſeth mee. I haue a meere authoritie ouer all, and it is in my power, to giue to one, and to deny to another, without iniury of either, which am bound to neither. I may doe with mine owne what I will.</p>
                  <p>The Obiection conceiues God to proceed in this buſineſſe as a Iudge; but <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewes that he proceeds as a Lord, who manumits of his bond-ſeruants whom he pleaſeth.</p>

If hee reprobate ſinners, it is iuſt, becauſe it agrees with their deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings. If he elect the ſinfull, it is iuſt, becauſe it agrees with his goodneſſe.</p>
                  <p>A Carpenter hauing diuers trees before him of like bignes, marks one to be ſawne into boord, another into ſparrs, &amp;c.

                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:14442:103"/> The Argument to proue that God is not vniuſt in reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting equalls, is this; No man euer challenged God to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt in his dealing with <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> but as he dealt with
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſo is his dealing with reprobates. Therefore the very force of the reaſon is contained in the end of Gods dealing vvith
<hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh;</hi> which alſo is the end of reprobation. Which end is not the deſtruction of the creature, but the glory of the Creator, and is thus concluded.</p>
                  <p>That which properly tends to the glory of God, is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, but good, by the nature of contraries; for that is euill which dishonoreth God, that good, which glorifieth him. But to reprobate equalls, properly tends to the glory of God. For hereby his power is declared. Therefore it is not vniuſt. For all creatures were made to ſet forth Gods glory, according to his, not their will.</p>
                  <p>The Turke commaunds his Vaſſals to deſtroy themſelues, to ſhew his power. Is this iuſt? No. Yet is God iuſt, in repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating for this end: Becauſe thoſe which hee reprobateth, deſerue it by their guiltineſſe.</p>

                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:14442:103"/>It is good therefore, that among them which are equally guilty, as ſome are elected, ſo ſome ſhould be reprobated; for ſo is Gods power knowne, and that is good.

                  <p>As of old (and ſo is it now alſo lawfull) Phyſicions begged the body of a condemned perſon, to anatomize it, that the puniſhment of the dead might further the good of the liuing; and as Apothecaries of dead mens fleſh make an expedient Triacle: ſo God makes Triacle of the Reprobate, to doe the Elect good, by ſtirring them vp to praiſe him for their mercy, and to repentance, to the purging out of the venimouſnes of their corrupt nature.</p>
                  <p>God will glorifie himſelfe vpon Reprobates, though it be nothing to their eaſe: they will not glorifie God in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he will, but they ſhall glorifie him in the manner they would not.</p>
                  <p>Thou diſhonoureſt God in thy life, ſaying with

                  <p>But for all this, let none ſinne, becauſe God ſhall thereby be glorified: as no man who hath his wits, will wound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that the Surgeon may be condemned for his skill in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him.

Wherein is a ſhort repetition of the Argument: and may thus Syllogiſtically be concluded.

                  <p>Here are two Emulations. The firſt of the Elect: <hi>Hee hath mercy on whom hee will.</hi> The ſecond of the Reprobate. <hi>Whom he will he hardeneth.</hi> The ſumme of theſe is before deliuered, wee will now conſider of them ſo, as wee ſhall note ſome things not before ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He hath mercy, on whom he will haue mercy.</hi> See of this before, <hi>verſe</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whom he will hee hardeneth.</hi> This is very difficult, and to bee made plaine. All conſent, that here the Apoſtle treateth of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and Reprobation, and that this Verſe compriſeth that which is before ſpoken, <hi>verſe</hi> 15, 16, 17. Therefore as that before is to be vnderſtood, ſo is this. And as large a ſenſe as Hauing mercy hath: ſo large muſt hardening haue. Then not onely of Actuall hauing, but of the purpoſe it muſt bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
                  <p>He ſhould haue ſaid, He ſtirres vp to deſtruction whom he will: but he ſaith, he hardneth, that he may ſhew how he ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp, namely by hardening.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:14442:104"/>Hardneſſe is an eſtate of a corrupt heart, whereby it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to all euill, yeelding no obedience to God: and it is threefold. Firſt, Naturall, which is the eſtate of all men. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that which is contracted by a cuſtome of ſinning, as a path is hardened by continuall trampling of paſſengers. Thirdly, Iudiciarie, which GOD inflicteth vpon men as a Iudgement. This is here meant: for finding all in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall hardneſſe, hee hardeneth, that is, reprobates whom hee pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> But all hardneſſe is finne. How then can God be ſaid to harden?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> There is a difference betweene hardnes and hardning. Hardnes is ſinne, but to harden is not alwayes ſo: and this is from God not as ſinne, but as his iuſt Iudgement. For it is not poſſible that by him we ſhould ſinne, by whom wee repent, and riſe from ſinne: euen as bitter water and ſweet iſſue not from the ſame fountaine. It is from God that we ſtand, from our ſelues that we fall.</p>
                  <p>God is ſaid to harden properly (not by making ſoft hearts to become hard, for <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart was neuer but hard; nor by putting hardnes into the heart, as the Papiſts vniuſtly charge vs to affirme; nor by only ſuffering vs to be hardened, which is the opinion of the Papiſts, dreaming idlely of an idle permiſsion in God: making him like the Poets
<hi>Iupitor,</hi> who was feaſting in Aethiopia, while things went out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but) three wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By forſaking: not making it hard: but not taking the hardnes away. He hardneth, that is, he ſoftneth not. He hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, not by putting in hardnes, but by not putting in the ſoftning oyle of his mercy, as the Sunne cauſes darknes, by with-drawing his light.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By puniſhing: for finding the heart hard (if hee pleaſe not to pardon it, and to ſoften the heart) hee inflicteth a new hardnes, as a puniſhment of the former. And this he inſtilleth not, but effecteth three wayes. 1. Either by Satan, to whoſe power hee deliuereth ſuch a heart for him to worke vpon. 2. Or by themſelues, giuing them ouer to their owne hearts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uſts. 3. Or by the preaching of the Word. For as the middle <pb n="194" facs="tcp:14442:105"/>region of the Ayre, is more cold by the Anteperiſtaſis, ſo the heart of a Reprobate more hard by the Word; not properly, but accidentally, as a reſty horſe, the more hee is ſpurred for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the more goes backward:</p>
                  <p>By actuating and exciting the preſent euill inclination of the Creatures, by propounding an occaſion to manifeſt it: as the Sunne, being in it ſelfe moſt cleane, by the force of his beames, draweth out of a dunghill ſtinking and vnpleaſant vapours.</p>
                  <p>Hardnes then is cauſed by the Commandement, Occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, by our owne malice Meritoriouſly. By Satan, Efficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. By God, Iudicially. So Satan is the Tormentor, a ſinfull man, the guilty perſon. God the Iudge, and that a Iuſt one, who knowes how to vſe euill meanes well; being no wayes the cauſe of ſinne, as ſinne; but alwayes ordering it for his glory, and the good of his Elect. For ſinne is like a Ship. Man the Mariner. Satan the ſpirit or winde. God the Pilot at the ſterne, directing all things to his glory.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. Whether a Reprobate be in ſuch an eſtate, that he cannot but ſinne?</p>

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2.</note> Alſo the opinion of the Papiſts, and <hi>Arminius,</hi> is hereby confuted; vvho hold a power in the vvil, of it ſelfe not to ſin. For the vnderſtanding of the trueth herein, we will firſt note what Free-will is. Secondly, what neceſſity is to be meant in this queſtion. Thirdly, the difference of actions. Free-will is a facultie in an intelligent nature, freely chuſing or refuſing the obiect, as it appeareth vnder the ſhew of good or euil. The forme of this freedome is, that by an inward beginning, it freely, without any violence, affects or reiects the obiect.</p>
                  <p>This freedome is diſtinguiſhed, to be a liberty of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariety or contradiction. The firſt is, when we chuſe one of two oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, as good or euill. The latter is, when one thing beeing propounded, we freely chuſe it, or refuſe it. The firſt vvas in
<hi>Adam,</hi> and (being of moralls) is not in vs. In the ſecond, the obiect is to be diſtinguiſhed: for it may either generally be conſidered, or particularly. If generally as euill, then we haue not this liberty: If particularly as this euill, then we may haue ſuch liberty.</p>
                  <p>Neceſſitie is two-fold; of coaction, of immutabilitie. The firſt is contrary to the nature of the will; the ſecond is not.</p>
                  <p>Actions are either naturall, as to eate, drinke, ſpeake, &amp;c. or ciuill, as to buy and ſell, &amp;c. or morall, as with or againſt the Law: or ſupernaturall, as to belieue and repent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:14442:107"/>In ſome naturall actions there is a liberty of contrariety &amp; contradiction. So alſo in ciuill. In morall, there is no liberty of contradiction in the generall, but in particular.</p>
                  <p>In good actions, as they are rightly performed, there is no libertie at all in a reprobate, or vnregenerate man, <hi>qua talis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Queſtion between the Aduerſaries and vs, is about the libertie of Contrariety in good and euill in the generall. The libertie of the will is not taken away: the liberty of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is. For <hi>Adams</hi> liberty is taken away, but the liberty of the will is not, neither can be, but that whatſoeuer it chuſeth, or refuſeth, it chuſeth or refuſeth freely.</p>
                  <p>The liberty of contrarietie, is rather a liberty of the ſtate of a perſon, then of the will: and ſo a neceſſity of ſinning &amp; free-will may ſtand together. A neceſſity, I ſay, not of coaction, but of immutabilitie, both by an inward beginning, and alſo by the decree, and a freedome I ſay of contradiction, but not of contrarietie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arminius</hi> thinketh, that if the will bee determined to one part, it loſeth the freedome, which is manifeſtly falſe. For God is the moſt free Agent, yet is his wil, by a moſt abſolute neceſſity, tied vnto that which is good: he being both moſt freely and moſt neceſſarily good.</p>
                  <p>The Diuell is now by a double neceſſitie euill, and yet free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euill: ſo our wills are free, though determined, becauſe they are not compelled. And whereas the <hi>Arminius</hi> auouch,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vide Aug. tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctat.</hi> 26. <hi>in Ioh.</hi>
                     </note> that God cannot determine the will to one part, without deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, it is neere vnto blaſphemy. If Orators can perſwade by their eloquence, cannot God, by the ſweet power of his Spirit ſo perſwade the heart, and determine it that it cannot actually reſiſt, whatſoeuer the poſſibility be in regard of nature vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected? If they ſay that ſuch poſsibilitie ſtill remaines in the wil to come into act; I would faine know what good they wil ſay the Spirit hath done in vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the nature of our wills is as euill diſpoſed as before grace receiued? If God cannot deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our wills infallibly to one part, then it ſhall be poſsible for the holy Angels and glorified Saints to fall from their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, which is horrible to affirme. For they hold that the will of man loſt nothing of its inward vertue by <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne: <pb n="200" facs="tcp:14442:108"/>not receiues any vertue or ſtrength from grace in the way to conuerſion.</p>
                  <p>But to returne, wee thus conclude; that the vnregenerate ſinne freely, and yet neceſſarily: yea, by how much the more neceſſarily, by ſo much the more freely, becauſe their wil hath brought vpon them this neceſsitie. Our will is alwaies free, though it be not alwaies good.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>To the ſecond Queſtion, the anſwere is negatiue: though a man that is borne lame, is to be excuſed before men for his halting, becauſe he was ſo borne: yet wicked men and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates are not excuſable before God for their ſinning, either by the neceſsitie of nature or of the Decree.</p>

Indeed, if God had created vs vnder ſuch a neceſsity, or now did compell vs, we deſiring to doe good, there might be ſome excuſe: but it is not ſo; nor ſo.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth the neceſsitie of the Decree excuſe. For God doth not by his decree force vs to euill, but finding vs euill, &amp; prone onely vnto it of our ſelues, hee decrees wee ſhall be ſo: and knowes that ſo we would be, though hee ſhould neuer decree. And thus he leaues vs to our ſelues, who haue no <pb n="201" facs="tcp:14442:108"/>more power to leaue ſinning, then a ſtone hath, not to goe downeward if it haue no impediment.</p>
                  <p>God forceth not the drunkard, or ſwearer, but they volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and with deſire commit theſe ſinnes, as their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences teſtifie. <hi>Iudas</hi> did nothing but by the Decree of God, yet he was not forced, but did that which he did, of his own accord moſt freely, his heart being ſet vpon couetouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>God gouernes the wils of the wicked, but hee takes not away either the will from man, or freedome from the will, but he moues their wils according to their owne Natures, as hee moues the heauens with a circular motion, fit for the nature of it. And when God moues, then the will freely deliberates, and willingly of it ſelfe conſents. So that wee may conclude this, with that of <hi>Bernard:</hi>

                  <p>In theſe two verſes, the ſawcineſſe of Cauillers is reproued, which appeared in that they ſubmit not themſelues as they ought to haue done, but out of their pride petulantly word it with their Creator, going about to bring the Decree of <pb n="202" facs="tcp:14442:109"/>Gods Predeſtination, vnder the Rule of their blind and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Reaſon, which is as poſſible as to gather vp all the Sea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Nut-ſhell.</p>
                  <p>Here are two things. Firſt, a Reprehenſion. Secondly, an Amplification.</p>
                  <p>The Reprehenſion is in theſe words: <hi>But, O man, what art thou that replyeſt againſt God?</hi> Where wee haue 1. The fault. 2. The perſon reprehended. The fault is diſputing with, or replying againſt God. The perſon noted, in theſe words: <hi>Thou, O Man.</hi> Where is alſo couched a reaſon of the Reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the Nothingnes, and baſe condition of man, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God. As if he ſhould ſay; Thou, O Man, Thou piece of Clay; Thou Dirt of the ſtreet: What art thou, baſe vile wretch? Doeſt thou reply againſt God? <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemes to ſpeake in ſome heate, his affections and holy zeale being ſtirred, at the malapertneſſe of the Cauiller, as the words and Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations ſhew.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What art thou, O Man?</hi> Theſe words haue great weight, as <hi>Anſelme</hi> obſerues, and call man to the conſideration of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. A greater Abaſing could not be (ſaith
<hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) this making him of leſſe account, then if
<hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid in plaine termes, that man had beene nothing, as
<hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>What is man?</hi> Compare a worme to vs, and vs to God, and there is more difference betweene vs and God, then betweene the baſeſt worme and vs.</p>
                  <p>This Reprehenſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on is amplified by a ſimilitude; where we haue the ſimilitude, and the confirmation of it.</p>
                  <p>The Similitude is in the reſt of the 20. verſe. The Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shall the thing formed, ſay to him that formedit, Why haſt thou made me thus?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Shall the wood quarrell with the Carpenter? The Iron with the Smith? The Clay with the Potter? This laſt is <hi>Pauls</hi> Similitude, taken out of <hi>Eſay</hi> 45.9. and by proportion teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that Man is not to quarrell with God about his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination. <hi>Shall the Pot ſay to the Potter, Why haſt thou made mee of this faſhion?</hi> It is the worſt faſhion; A man without hands might haue made as good a one. Much leſſe may man which <pb n="203" facs="tcp:14442:109"/>is but a pot-ſheard, argue the caſe with God, complaining of his Decree. For there is more difference betweene vs and God, then betweene the Pot and the Potter, though an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour were the Potter, and the Pot neuer ſo baſe.</p>
                  <p>The force of this ſimilitude is confirmed, verſe 21. from the Right and Authoritie of the Potter ouer his Clay.

                        </gap>.</note> Hath not the Potter power, that is, authoritie ouer his Clay, &amp;c?</p>
                  <p>The reaſon is from the leſſe. The Clay may not expoſtulate with the Potter, hauing power of the ſame lumpe, to make one veſſell to Honour, and another to diſhonour. Much more hath God authoritie of the ſame damned and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticall lumpe, to harden ſome, and to haue mercy on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome.</p>
                  <p>As therefore the Potter is not to be reprehended in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo neither GOD in his: who hath more authoritie and power ouer man, then the Potter ouer his Clay. The Potter made not his Clay, but both Clay and Potter are made by God. But God made man, and therefore his right is more.</p>
                  <p>In this Confirmation God is the Potter, Corrupt man the Clay. The veſſels of Honor the Elect, the veſſels to dishonour, the Reprobate.</p>
                  <p>Here are two things ſoundly taught. Firſt, that as the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath power ouer his Clay, ſo God hath more ouer Man. Secondly, that as the Potter makes veſſels of honour and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour out of the ſame lump at his pleaſure, and is not bound to render a reaſon of his ſo doing to his Pots: So God is not vniuſt, though from among men of equall Corruption, hee chooſe ſome, and reprobate others. In thoſe he chuſeth, hee is exceeding good; and in thoſe he refuſeth, no way culpable, neither taking away any goodneſſe, nor adding any euill to the Reprobate; but of baſe ſtuffe (ſuch is man corrupted) he makes baſe veſſels, ſuch are the Reprobate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> Though the Pot may not plead againſt the Potter, yet the Potter hath no reaſon to bee angry with his Pot, if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine no otherwiſe then he hath made it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Potter is not angry with his Pot for the faſhion in which he made it, but for the ſoyle which it hath gathered
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:14442:110"/>ſince he made it. So if we had remained as wee were at firſt created, God would not haue beene angry with vs: but wee are corrupted, and therefore he may iuſtly be offended.</p>

                  <p>IN theſe Verſes is a reall anſwere to the obiection, which was this. If Gods will bee the cauſe of hardening, then (ſaith the Cauiller) I would ſee, how God can iuſtly puniſh me, if in proceſſe of time I obey him not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> anſwere is from the manner of Gods dealing, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he may iuſtly puniſh, becauſe hee ſuffers them with long patience, not onely giuing them ſpace to repent, if they can or will, but alſo affording them many outward helpes which he is not bound to doe.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe they might obiect, that if GOD would giue them grace, they alſo would obey; and why did not GOD deſtroy man, hauing ſinned, and create him anew without ſinne?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> tels them that God could giue them grace, or haue created man anew, but it is his pleaſure to ſuffer wicked men with much patience, that hee may make knowne his power and wrath vpon the wicked, and ſo declare the riches of his mercy on the Elect. And what hath any to doe with it, if God would haue it ſo, who doth all things iuſtly?</p>
                  <p>Here is a <hi>Reticentia,</hi> whereby ſomething is to bee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. If God will, what is that to thee? or what canſt thou ſay againſt it?</p>
                  <p>For the meaning, this is to be remembred, that principally theſe two verſes ſpeake of Reprobates, and what is ſpoken of the Elect, is ſpoken by occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Here are two things. 1. A deſcription of the Reprobates and the Elect. 2. That which is ſpoken of Reprobates.</p>
                  <p>Reprobates are Veſſels of wrath prepared to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Elect are veſſels of mercy, which God hath prepared to Glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:14442:112"/>In theſe deſcriptions are two things. 1. The Parts. 2. The Amplification. The Parts are two. 1. The
<hi>Genus.</hi> 2. The Difference.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Genus</hi> in both: They are Veſſels. The forme on the part of the Reprobates, they are Veſſels of wrath: On the part of the Elect. They are veſſels of Mercy.</p>
                  <p>The Amplification on the part of the Reprobates: <hi>They are veſſels prepared to deſtruction.</hi> Of the other: <hi>They are veſſels which God hath prepared to Glory.</hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſſels:</hi> The word in the Originall, ſignifieth not onely a Veſſell by the hollowneſſe capable to receiue and containe things, but an Inſtrument or any Vtenſil, as all the miniſtring veſſels in the Tabernacle, as Fire-pans, Tongs. Beſomes, &amp;c. are called in the Hebrew, by the word here vſed:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.21.
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> ſo alſo are called the furniture of a horſe and warlike munitions: and the tackling of a ſhip is called by a word like vnto it.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 27.10.</note> Now it may be tranſlated an Inſtrument; but more fitly and fully a veſſel, ſuch as wee vſe to containe things liquid or dry. So that the Reprobates and Elect, are veſſels vpon whom God powreth Wrath and Mercy, as we powre Water into a Veſſell.</p>
                  <p>A Veſſell in Scripture is applyed two wayes.
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.4. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi>
3.7. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.15.</note> To the body alone; or to the whole Man: and ſo in three reſpects. 1. Of Sexe, of Office, of Eſtate, and ſo in this place.</p>
                  <p>There are two things in which the Elect and Reprobate are alike. Firſt, they are both Veſſels of the ſame lumpe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they ſerue both for one generall vſe, that is, for Gods glory.</p>
                  <p>Their mayne difference is, that the Reprobates are Veſſels of Wrath vnto Damnation: The Elect, veſſels of Mercy vnto Saluation; and both for the glory of God.</p>
                  <p>A veſſell of Wrath is ſuch a one vpon whom GOD will will ſhew no mercy, but will be angry with him for his ſinne, leaue him in it, and at laſt take vengeance on him for it. A veſſell of Mercy, ſuch a one vpon whom God purpoſeth to ſhew mercy, in forgiuing his ſinne, bringing him out of it, and vnto ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>Here care is to be had of diſtinguiſhing ſome like phraſes, as a Veſſell of Wrath, and a child of Wrath. Theſe differ. A
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:14442:112"/>child of wrath may bee a veſſell of Mercy, but a veſſell of Wrath cannot. As <hi>Paul</hi> and the Elect Epheſians are by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the children of Wrath, as well as others.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3.</note> A child of wrath notes our corrupt eſtate. A veſſell of wrath the Deſtination of ſuch a one to damnation. But a child of Diſobedience and a veſſell of Wrath, are all one.</p>
                  <p>Prepare to deſtruction: and which God hath prepared to glory.</p>
                  <p>In both theſe are two things. Firſt, the Action. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the End. The End both of the Reprobate and Elect, not the end of election, and reprobation. For the end of Gods Decree in both, is Gods glory, but the end of the veſſels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, is their honour or dishonour.</p>
                  <p>The Reprobate are prepared: but God hath prepared the Elect. This diuerſitie of ſpeaking is not without great weight. The Reprobate are prepared or fitted. By whom? Doubtleſſe by God: but yet the Participle Paſſiue, here vſed, and not of the Elect, notes that all the preparation of the Elect vnto glory, is of God: of the Reprobate to deſtruction, is both of God and of themſelues. Of themſelues, being <hi>apta,</hi> fit, of God, being <hi>aptata,</hi> fitted to deſtruction, for that prauity in them, whereby they are fit to be deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>To deſtruction: Not as it is the miſery of the Creature, but the way to glorifie the Creator.</p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1.</note> There is great difference betweene the Elect and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; both in their vſe, and end; and hereby appeares the happineſſe of the Elect, and the miſery of the Reprobate.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For vſe: The Elect are for Mercy, the Reprobate for Wrath. VVhen God pleaſeth to ſhew mercy, the Elect are brought forth. When Wrath, then the Reprobate, who are the proper ſubiect of Wrath, as the Elect are of Mercy.</p>
                  <p>As the houſholder hath diuers veſſels, ſome for baſe vſes, and ſome for the vſe of his Table, and hee vſeth not the baſe veſſels at his Table: ſo God will for nothing but for venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:14442:113"/>of the Reprobate. And as the Apothecarie hath diuers boxes and pots, in ſome of which hee putteth nothing but Cordials, in other nothing but poyſons, and things of the like dangerous nature, and carefully diſtinguiſheth them: So doth God with the Elect and Reprobate. Alſo as a Carpenter hath ſome courſe tooles which he vſeth about ſtones and grauell, about which hee vſeth not his choyſe tooles: ſo if God hath a baſe worke to effect, he hath a Reprobate, if a more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, he vſually hath one of his Elect at hand. If Chriſt bee to bee crucified, hee will not vſe the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> or ſuch choyſe pieces; but a
<hi>Iudas,</hi> a <hi>Pilate,</hi> a <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>We preach Mercy: if thou be a Reprobate, it is not meant to thee. Wee preach Wrath: if thou be an Elect, this is not meant to thee, but to the Reprobate. It may be, that when mercy is preaching and powring downe, the Reprobate lookes after it, and thinkes to haue it; but bee deceiues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. When a Father is cutting bread among his Children, their little eyes are vpon euery piece that is cut: It may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the dogge ſtands by (Reprobates may not grudge the compariſon, whoſe ſtate is worſe then the dogs.) The dogge it may be ſtands by, and gapes for the bread: but the Father giues the bread to the children: he giues to the dogge alſo, but it is a cudgell or whip, and ſpurnes him from him. So Mercy is the childrens bread, it hangs not for the Reprobates tooth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is great difference alſo betweene the Elect and Reprobate, in regard of their end. The Elect ſhall bee ſaued, the Reprobate, aſſuredly damned. Sometimes hee vſeth the Reprobates as a rodde, to chaſtiſe his children, but when hee hath ſerued his pleaſure by them, he deales with them as he did with the King of <hi>Aſſur,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſay</hi> 10.5,12.</note> he throwes them into the fire.</p>
                  <p>God vſeth them, who cannot but vſe them well, and they doe no more but what he hath appointed; and when they haue done according to his ſecret appointment, they ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for not obeying his reuealed appointment. Yea, he will make that which they doe againſt his will, to ſerue his owne will, and our good.</p>

But if there bee nothing in thee but Infidelitie, Pride, Hypocriſie, Couetouſneſſe, &amp;c. and they continue, without queſtioning, thou art a veſſell of dishonour.</p>
                  <p>It may eaſily be knowne what wee haue within: for as a Pomander if you chafe it, yeelds a comfortable ſmell; and
<hi>Aſſafaetida</hi> or the like ſtrong thing if it be rubbed offends; ſo deale with one truely godly, and thou ſhalt heare nothing but ſauoury and gracious ſpeeches; the opening of his mouth will be as the opening of a Box of ſweet ointment: thou ſhalt alſo haue none but conſcionable dealing at his hands.

Secondly, the end: Which is to be conceiued in a double reſpect. Firſt, of the Reprobates, to ſhew his power and wrath vpon them. Secondly, of the Elect: that ſo the riches of his mercy and glory toward the Elect, might more famouſly appeare.</p>

                  <p>THe end of Gods longanimitie in regard of the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, is (according to theſe words) to declare his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull wrath in their condemnation.</p>
                  <p>In theſe words wee will firſt conſider certaine things here attributed to God, and then the matter it ſelfe in them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                  <p>There are two things attributed to God here, 1. Anger or Wrath: and 2. Power. For the firſt, Anger or Wrath is defined by Philoſophers, to be a deſire of reuenge with griefe and perturbation, through the boyling of the bloud about the heart. It is called of the Hebrues,
<hi>Aph,</hi> becauſe it diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers it ſelfe in the dilating and contracting of the noſe thrills. Thus is it in vs. Such a thing is in God, but not with pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; for God is not ſubiect to paſſion. As God doth not repent as man doth, yet repentance is attributed vnto him: ſo alſo may it be ſaid of Anger. As repentance is in GOD without griefe or error: ſo vvrath, without paſſion or pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
                  <p>God is ſaid to repent, when hee changeth that which is done, and to be angry, when hee puniſheth that which is ill done; not beeing indeed angry, but ſeeming ſo to them which ſuffer. For as a man in his angry mood, woundeth and killeth; ſo when God puniſheth, he is ſaid to be angry: Anger noting in God, not an affection, but an effect of ſome diuine perfection: namely, his vindicatiue iuſtice.</p>
                  <p>Anger is attributed to God after the manner of men<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>As Anger, ſo Power is attributed to God: but anger im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, this properly. It is alwaies actiue in God. In him is

                  <p>This power is Almightineſſe; and it is abſolute or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. By the firſt, he is able to doe all he will, and more then he actually doth will: for as there is in God a knowledge of things which neuer were or ſhall be, ſo is there Abilitie to do that, which hee neuer will ſhall be done. Hee can raiſe vp of ſtones children to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and giue Chriſt more then 12. legions of Angels: but we neuer read he did ſo.</p>
                  <p>By the ſecond, he can doe all he will, notwithſtanding all oppoſition, and that in an inſtant.</p>
                  <p>Q. Can God doe all things?</p>
                  <p>A. It is a ſhamefull queſtion for the Creature to mooue of the Creator. Some things are in poſſible to God, becauſe he is God: of which a pious obſeruer of Gods maieſtie would haue vs not to ſay, God cannot doe them, but, they cannot be done.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The matter it ſelfe in this end, is, that God lets vvicked men alone, and ſuffers them to haue a being here, which are not worthy to tread vpon the earth, that all the world may take knowledge of his anger againſt ſinne, and of his power to execute the ſame.</p>

                     <hi>The wrath ſhewed on the Reprobates, doth amplifie and commend the mercy to the Elect. Gods ſauing</hi> Noah, <hi>and drowning the world, made his mercy to</hi> Noah
<hi>the more conſpicuous. The plaguing of Egypt, and ſparing the Iſraelites, by compariſon, the more ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth the goodneſſe of God to the Iſraelites. So alſo the drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of</hi> Pharaoh <hi>and his hoaſt: and their deliuerance noted:</hi> Exod. 14.30,31.</p>

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> Here are two comforts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the riches of glory layd vp for the Elect, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth againſt our preſent baſeneſſe, and diſgrace put vpon vs by the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we haue friends here: but many times we faile of their helpe: either for want of loue in them, or for want of power: But God wants neither: nay, hee is infinite in both. He hath riches of glory. Whatſoeuer thou wanteſt, as Faith, Repentance, &amp;c. Aske and thou ſhalt haue. That fountaine can neuer be drawne dry.</p>
                  <p>Learne Humilitie. For thou didſt neuer earne or purchaſe the happineſſe thou haſt and ſhalt haue: and that there ſhould be ſuch difference betweene thee and a Reprobate, it comes from the riches of Gods glory.</p>
                  <p>It is not a little thing or ordinary, which God giues his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, but riches of Glory: the pledge of it here in Faith and Sanctification, the perfection of it hereafter. To bring vs to this eſtate, and to make vs capable of ſuch glory, coſt the <pb n="221" facs="tcp:14442:118"/>treaſure euen of heauen: the richeſt Iewell there, euen Chriſt Ieſus was pawned for it. Forget not to bee thankefull: And that thou mayſt ſo much the more doe it: Compare thy eſtate with the eſtate of a Reprobate, thou wert in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Conſider the torments to which the Reprobate, and the riches of Glory to which thou art reſerued.</p>
                  <p>How doth God deale with vs, as though we were Princes children, who indeed are beggars brats! Hee takes a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and ſcourgeth him with Scorpions, to fray thee from ſin, and to ſhew thee his loue. When thou feeleſt thy ſelfe dull to praiſe God; conſider how God hath diſcerned thee from the Reprobates, then whom, in thy ſelfe thou art not better ſo much as a hayre.</p>
                  <p>If God had ſaued all, it had beene an Infinite mercy, and an Infinite cauſe to praiſe him: but Now ſeeing many are damned, to them which are ſaued, it is the more cauſe of thanksgiuing. The Sunne is glorious and beautifull: but if the Moone and euery Starre had as much brightnes, it would not be ſo admired. So this makes the mercy of GOD to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſo much the more admirable, by compariſon of his wrath on the Reprobate. On the contrary, it is augmentation of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Reprobate; to ſee how God vſeth his Elect, to heare how graciouſly Chriſt ſpeakes to them: Come ye bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: to behold Them goe triumphing to heauen, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues thruſt downe with the Diuell to hell. To ſee what they loſe ſhall more torment them, then that which they feele. This ſhall euen cut them to the heart, as may by proportion bee gathered out of the Goſpell.

                  <p>Apply this to all occaſions of mercy to thy ſelfe, which thou obſerueſt others to want. Wouldſt thou be ſtirred vp to praiſe God for our long peace?

                  <p>Wee are the ſubiect of Calling; but power to obey the Calling of God wee haue not, till God hath created it in vs. As water, being by nature cold, may be made hot, and yet it hath no naturall inclination to heat: ſo the Fleſh hath no eares to heare, nor eyes to ſee, but as GOD createth them.

                  <p>The preaching of the Word is Gods ordinary voice to call. Firſt, be thankfull that this voice ſoundeth among vs, for it ſoundeth not in all places of the vvorld.

Thirdly, that thou haſt a mind to vnderſtand that which is taught, for euery one cannot: as fooles, and frantikes, and ſuch a one might God haue made thee.

And becauſe the Iewes could not endure this, he brings two Teſtimonies out of <hi>Oſee,</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay; This that I write, and this that daily is fulfilled, concerning the calling of the Gentiles to Grace, is nothing elſe but that which God long agoe cauſed the Prophets to preach vnto our Fathers: for the Prophet <hi>Oſee,</hi> brings in GOD himſelfe calling the Gentiles, his beloued, his people and children.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe Teſtimonies is out of <hi>Oſee</hi>
2.23. The <pb n="226" facs="tcp:14442:121"/>ſecond, Oſee 1.10.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words are not ſpoken of the Iſraelites, and applyed to the Gentiles by ſimilitude, as ſome haue thought. For theſe termes, <hi>A Nation not beloued, Not the people of God,</hi> are conſtantly in the Prophets taken for the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>The matter then is thus to be conceiued. God commands Oſee to rebuke the Iſraelites by a Parable,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Conſule Pareum ſuper Oſeam.</hi>
                     </note> wherein hee is commaunded to take to wife <hi>Gomer,</hi> and to beget children, which he doth. He takes <hi>Gomer,</hi> that is, hee preacheth <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> which ſignifieth Conſumption, Deſolation, and vtter Vaſtation to the Iſraelites. The effect of this Sermon, is ſaid to be a ſonne, begotten by the Prophet: at whoſe Sermon, the Iſraelites grew worſe and worſe, for the which they are called by God, <hi>Iidſreel:</hi> that is, Diſperſion. Hee preacheth <hi>Gomer</hi> againe, and begets a daughter, whoſe name is, <hi>Lo-Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chama,</hi> No mercy: that is, the people perſiſt in their ſinnes, and therefore God threatneth to ſhew them no mercy. Hee preacheth <hi>Gomer</hi> the third time, and <hi>Lo-Ammi</hi> is borne; that is, Not my people. By which name, for their incurable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſneſſe, the Lord threatens them with extreme abiection. And, that they ſhould not complaine, that if they be caſt off, then the promiſe to
<hi>Abraham,</hi> that his ſeed ſhould be as the ſand, ſhould faile: God in the 10. verſe of the firſt Chapter, tells them, that That promiſe ſhould be made good, though they all periſh. Yea, that when he hath deſtroyed them, that promiſe ſhould chiefly be fulfilled: a greater company of all Nations becomming the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then euer the Iſraelites were. For as all the ſand is not on the ſhore of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan; ſo not of the Iewes onely, but of the Gentiles in all the world, is a poſterity to be borne vnto <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe verſes is a double deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Gentiles; The 1. of their eſtate before their calling, expreſſed by Negatiues: Not beloued; Not receiuing mercy; Not my people. The 2. of their eſtate after their calling, expreſſed by Affirmatiues: My people, and Beloued, The children of the liuing God.</p>
                  <p>This ſecond eſtate is amplyfied three waies; Firſt, from the place: In the place, not in the ſtead, but in the place; as in England, France, Denmarke, in any place. Not onely the <pb n="227" facs="tcp:14442:121"/>Riuers of Canaan, but All Riuers ſhall flowe with Milke and Honey. Yea, the Hony and Milke of Canaan ſhall flow into all Countreys: As a Riuer being ſtopt, ouerflowes the banks, and drownes all; euen ſo the ſtreame of Gods mercies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtopt in Canaan by their ſinnes, flowes ouer into al parts of the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the meanes or Inſtrument of conueying this grace to all Nations, which is the preaching of the Word, notified in this word, <hi>They ſhall be Called.</hi>

                  <p>In the firſt Teſtimony are two things. Firſt, the thing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed. Secondly, the Amplification.</p>
                  <p>The Thing witneſſed, is, that but a Remnant of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael ſhall be ſaued. A Remnant notes a ſmall Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in compariſon of the whole.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saued:</hi> The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, ſhall returne: not onely from the captiuitie of Babylon, but from ſinne, as appeares, verſe 21. They ſhall returne vnto God. Hence one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues,

                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:14442:123"/>that none can be ſaued, but they which returne, that is, which repent.</p>
                  <p>The Amplification is foure-fold. Firſt, from the Perſon bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring witneſſe, which is <hi>Eſay. Paul</hi> deliuers not this in his own Name, which he knew was odious to them, but in <hi>Eſayes,</hi> a Prophet of chiefe account. <hi>Paul</hi> was not inferiour to <hi>Eſay,</hi> nor his Teſtimony of leſſer Authoritie: for they wrote by the ſame Spirit: but he knew they would except againſt him: therefore he takes one, againſt whom lay no Exception.</p>
                  <p>Obſeruation. It was a great corruption in the Iewes, to examine truth by the perſon: and a foule fault in many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, who haue the Word in reſpect of perſons. If the Preacher bee of their Cut, they will heare him, and admire him, how ſillily ſo euer he ſpeakes; but if he be not, they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme not the Word, though neuer ſo ſoundly deliuered.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the Manner of the Teſtimonie: <hi>He cryed:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſome note the Prophets zeale, which alſo ſhould be in all Miniſters, but others vnderſtand it of plainneſſe and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe alſo: as if <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould ſay to a Iew, What? Art thou an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, becauſe I ſpeake ſo plainely and boldly of thy reiection? Is not <hi>Eſay</hi> as plaine and bold?</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="4">4. The fourth Amplification, is verſ. 28. which the Ancients haue expounded of the manner, how the Remnant ſhould be ſaued;

                  <p>The later Writers expound it as a reaſon why but a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhould be ſaued: namely, becauſe God hath purpoſed to make a ſhort word, that is, buſineſſe or worke, as it is well tranſlated in his Maieſties Bible.

                  <p>In the other Teſtimonie, verſe 29. we haue alſo two parts. Firſt the Poſition. Secondly, the Amplification.</p>
                  <p>The Poſition: <hi>A ſeede ſhall be ſaued.</hi> By ſeede is not meant The Goſpell, or the Apoſtles, or Chriſt: but the ſame that is meant by Remnant: that is, a few: That as but a few were preſerued at the Captiuitie of Babylon: So but a few ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Promiſes.

                  </p>
                  <p>This is amplified two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from the Author of this Reſeruation, <hi>God,</hi> here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Lord of Hoſts. All creatures are his Hoſts, in regard of their multitude, as an Armie conſiſts of many troupes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in regard of their order, which is admirable, as order makes an Armie-beautifull. Thirdly, in regard of obedience: for no Souldier is ſo ready and preſt, at the command of his Centurion, as all creatures are ready to fulfill the will of God. Euen Flyes, and Lice, if God muſter them together. God can arme all the creatures againſt ſinfull man, the leaſt whereof, euen a Flye, is able to make an end of vs, if God giue Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is amplified from the grieuouſneſſe and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie <pb n="232" facs="tcp:14442:124"/>(as I may ſay) of the Deletion of the Iewes,
<hi>if God had not beene mercifull.</hi> Expreſſed by a Similitude of the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sodom and Gomorah, where all periſhed ſaue <hi>Lot</hi> and his two Daughters.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme is, that as many thouſands of the Iewes periſhed by the ſword of <hi>Hazael, Ioaſh, Sennacherib, Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar, &amp;c.</hi> and had all, if God had not preſerued ſome few: ſo but a few onely of them ſhall bee ſaued from euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtruction, of which thoſe deſtructions before named were types.</p>

                  <p>IN theſe verſes is a collection, wherein <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection which might be made againſt that, which hee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered <pb n="234" facs="tcp:14442:125"/>out of <hi>Oſee</hi> and <hi>Eſay;</hi> and ſo prepares way for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the tenth Chapter.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme of the Obiection is this: If the Gentiles be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and the Iewes reiected, then is the righteouſneſſe of the Law condemned. To this <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers in part here, more fully in the next Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Here are two parts; 1. A Queſtion, <hi>What ſhall we ſay then?</hi> 2. The Anſwere, in all the reſt of the words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> If the Gentiles be receiued, and the Iewes caſt out, what ſhall we ſay then?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> This will we ſay, quoth <hi>Paul,</hi> That the Gentiles which followed not the Righteouſneſſe of the Law, haue attained Righteouſnes: and the Iewes which followed the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of the Law, haue not attained to it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt part of this Anſwere is in the 30. verſe, vvith a Reaſon annexed; Becauſe they ſought the Righteouſnes of the Law by faith.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of the Anſwere is in the 31. verſe, with a reaſon alſo thereof in the firſt part of verſe 32, Becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but by their owne works.</p>
                  <p>That theſe may the better be vnderſtood, let vs ſee what a Gentile is, and what a Iew. A Gentile is deſcribed, Ephe. 2.11,12. and
4,17,18,19. A Iew, is one lineally deſcended of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> who is circumciſed, and ſtrict in keeping the Ceremoniall Law, and alſo of the letter of the morall Law, as appeareth by the young man in the Goſpel.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now this makes the matter the more ſtrange; that ſuch deuout people, ſo eagerly purſuing the righteouſneſſe of the Law, ſhould not be iuſtified, when we can haue no agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with God, without ſuch a righteouſnes performed which the Law requireth: and that the Gentile ſhould obtaine Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, hauing no care of the Law.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon ſhewes how this came to paſſe. The Gentiles ſought Righteouſnes, not in themſelues, but in Chriſt, which they apprehending by faith, were by it iuſtified in the light of God: And the Iewes ſeeking it in themſelues, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the goodnes of their owne workes, to attaine to the righteouſnes of the Law, miſſed of it, it beeing in no mans <pb n="235" facs="tcp:14442:125"/>power perfectly to fulfill the ſame: onely Chriſt hath fulfilled it. Hence was it, that our Sauiour ſo ſharply reprehended the Scribes and Phariſes, zealous followers of the Law, keeping company with Publicans and ſinners, at which thoſe Ievves were greatly offended.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Peter</hi> fiſhed all night and caught nothing; ſo they loſt all their labour, becauſe they caſt not out their net on the right ſide, where Chriſt was to be found.</p>

                  <p>Now alas! this righteouſneſſe cannot auaile: nay, indeed the opinion of it is one of the greateſt impediments to a mans ſaluation that can be; becauſe it is hard to bee vnpoſſeſt of that which attributes ſo much to our ſelues.

                  <p>The Iewes purſue and follow after righteouſneſſe: but as hee that runnes in a race, if hee ſtumble and fall, loſeth the prize, for another gets before him: So they ſtumbled at the meanes of Chriſt, in whom onely righteouſneſſe was to bee had. <hi>Is not this the Carpenter,</hi> Maries <hi>Sonne</hi> ſay they?
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.3.</note> Can he giue vs a righteouſnes better then our owne? So when Chriſt told the woman of Samaria of Water of Life. <hi>Art thou</hi> (ſaith ſhe in contempt)

                     <hi>greater then our Father</hi> Iacob <hi>that gaue vs this Well?</hi> Canſt thou giue better water then this? Thou art a like man.</p>
                  <p>In this reaſon, Chriſt, in regard of his outward pouertie, is compared to a ſtumbling ſtone. And the Iewes refuſing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him, becauſe of his pouerty, are ſaid to ſtumble, and not to attaine the righteouſneſſe for Iuſtification, which they purſued.</p>
                  <p>Wee ſtumble many times at a ſtone, which for the little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not marked: ſo the littleneſſe of Chriſt was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their ſtumbling: they thinking that the neglect of ſo meane a perſon (as hee outwardly ſeemed) could not preiudice them.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe ſome might aske, who this ſtone is, and who laid it in their way? <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewes theſe things, with other, verſe 33. by the Teſtimonie of <hi>Eſay</hi> 8.14. and 28.16. where we haue fiue things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Who this Stone is: namely, Chriſt: who is often called by <hi>Dauid</hi> his Rocke:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.22.</note> not for offence, but defence:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20.</note> and by
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:14442:128"/>him and <hi>Paul,</hi> a chiefe Corner Stone: becauſe as the walles of a building are ioyned and holden together by the Corner Stone, ſo the Church is vpholden by Chriſt. But here hee is a ſtumbling ſtone. Not in himſelfe, properly, in the firſt place: but by accident, when he is reiected of the builders. Hee is ſo Paſſiuely, not Actiuely: for hee is giuen to ſaue men, not to deſtroy them: to keepe them vp, not to make them fall: In his owne Nature he is a Ieſus: but when hee is not receiued, he is a Rocke of offence, and becomes a ſeuere Iudge.</p>
                  <p>A Stone to ſtumble at, and a Rocke of offence, are diuerſly by Interpreters applyed: The firſt, to the Gentiles: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, to the Iewes: and contrarily alſo by ſome; a Stone, to the Ignorant: a Rocke, to vnbeleeuers; by ſome a Stone to his Incarnation, a Rocke to his Paſſion, &amp;c. but theſe are too curious, the beſt is to take them as ſignifying one and the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>Three things made the Iewes to ſtumble. Firſt, the meane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Perſon, they expected that the Meſſiah ſhould haue come as another <hi>Alexander.</hi>

Thirdly, the qualitie of his Doctrine, full of reproofe of their Hypocriſie and vile dealing: They ſought to bee praiſed of all men: but hee vncaſed their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and laid them open, denouncing woe, woe, woe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where this ſtone is laid: in Sion, in Iewry, in the Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Who put it there. God himſelfe: in the firſt and chiefe end, to build men vp to ſaluation: but if they refuſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey: then to be a Rocke of offence.</p>

                  <p>So when we heare the Word, not as the word of man, but as it is indeed the Word of the liuing God, it will be power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and worke Faith in our hearts.</p>

                  <p>There are diuers kindes of them which ſtumble at Chriſt, and his Word.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. The Turkes, who cannot be brought to ſeeke for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in him, who hath hanged on a Tree.</p>

The Papiſts: Tell them that their Maſſes doe no Good: that workes iuſtifie not; that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not helpe vs; that Chriſt is our onely Mediator: They cry out, Sedition, Hereſie, &amp;c.

                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:14442:129"/>4. The Worldling: Who affecting pleaſure and gaine, and perceiuing the Croſſe to follow the Goſpell, is by and by offended.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Ignorant people; who are offended with the paucitie of Profeſſors: If this be the true Religion, why is it ſo much ſpoken againſt? Shall none be ſaued (ſay they) but they which follow Sermons, &amp;c?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. A ſort of people among vs called Separatiſts, or Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whom I much pitie, becauſe I am perſwaded there are ſome amongſt them, that are conſcionable. Theſe ſtumble at our mixt aſſemblies; they will not know that the beſt field hath Tares, the beſt Wheate chaffe, the beſt men faults, and the pureſt Chriſtians defects. Yea, they will not ſee the beames in their owne company, but in our Church euery moate troubles them.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Our ordinarie profane people, who cannot afford a good word either to a Preacher, or conſcionable Profeſſor. Theſe ſay; It was neuer merry world ſince there was ſo much Preaching: ſo much following of Sermons, is to make men Beggers, Fooles, to runne out of their wits. What is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with theſe men? What is that which troubles them? The Truth is: Theſe men which ſay after this manner, are either Drunkards, Whore-maſters, common Swearers, or giuen to ſome notorious lewdnes, and becauſe the Word findes them out, and diſeaſes them in their euill courſes, therefore they are offended at it: If they bee not controuled for their faults, they are quiet enough. <hi>Herod</hi> was a wonderfull Goſpeller for a while, till <hi>Iohn</hi> told him of his Inceſt: So the Preacher is a good man, till he tell them of their faults.</p>

But if thou bee profane, and thereby an enemy to thy ſelfe, then is the Word thy enemy, which if thou didſt loue &amp; obey, would be thy faithfull friend, euen in the houre of Death.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> threw his Rod out of his hand, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Serpent, and hee was afraid of it: but when he laid hold of it, and tooke it to him, it became That Rodde <pb n="243" facs="tcp:14442:129"/>whereby hee wrought many Miracles. So, caſt the Word from thee, and it is a Serpent; but lay hold of it by Faith, and obey it, and thou ſhalt haue the great Worke of thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation wrought thereby.</p>
                  <p>Bleſſed is the man which is not offended at Chriſt and his Word: It is hard to kicke againſt the prickes. If a man ſtrike his hand vpon the point of a ſpeare, he hurts not the ſpeare, but his hand. If hee ſpurne at a ſtone, hee hurts not the ſtone, but his owne feete: ſo whoſoeuer maligne and ſpeake euill of the Word: Alas, they hurt not that, but themſelues, euen to their vtter condemnation, if they repent not. If thou haſt beene a deſpiſer, repent: loue and obey the Word, that thou maiſt be ſaued.</p>

                  <p>In this Chapter, the Apoſtle anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth another Argument, in which the Iewes put wonderfull truſt: <hi>viz.</hi> in their holineſſe and zeale, thus; If none be ſaued but thoſe which beleeue in Chriſt, then vvhat ſhall become of our ſtrict and zealous obſeruation of the Law morall and Ceremoniall? <hi>Paul</hi> tells them, that all this auailes not before God, but faith, which attaines that righteouſneſſe which iuſtifieth in his ſight.

21.</note> To be both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaued of the promiſes, and alſo to be ſtript of their holineſſe, &amp; to be left naked before the Iudgement ſeat of Chriſt, muſt needs be grieuous.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Paul</hi> knowing, and that they would be not a little <pb n="246" facs="tcp:14442:131"/>incenſed againſt him; and hauing experience that ſuch prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching cauſed him great trouble, before he comes to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he makes a Preface, whereby hee endeuours to aſſwage their minds, and to approue his loue to them, that he might take away all preiudicate opinions of him.</p>
                  <p>So in this Chapter we haue two parts; 1. A Preface, ver. 1. 2. The matter it ſelfe in the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The Preface, verſe 1. is by inſinuation, or proteſtation of his loue, in which are two things; 1. The Thing proteſted. 2. The Amplification of it.</p>
                  <p>The thing proteſted, is his Loue. The Amplification is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; 1. From the perſons to whom he proteſts loue: that is, to the Iſraelites. 2. From the Arguments of his loue, vvhich are three. 1. A friendly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pellation, hee calls them Brethren, in regard of the ſame Country and Nation. 2. From a deſire of their ſaluation. The word tranſlated,
<hi>hearts deſire,</hi> ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth two things. Firſt, to haue a good opinion. Secondly, to wiſh well vnto. <hi>Paul</hi> thought wel of them, and vviſhed them well, whatſoeuer they thought of him. This deſire is ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from the ſubiect of it, his heart. It was not a fained glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing loue, as is the friendſhip of the world, from the teeth outward, but euen from his very heart. Thirdly, from his prayers for their ſaluation. A ſingular token of loue. This is amplified, firſt, from the obiect to whom he prayed, To God. Secondly, from the end, or ſumme of his prayer, That they might be ſaued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Why doth <hi>Paul</hi> pray for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who haue crucified Chriſt, are enemies to the Goſpell, and hated and reiected of God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> He intends the general calling of the Iewes; of which, chap. 11. Or with condition of Gods will; or onely of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; or to ſhew his willingneſſe to wiſh well euen to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                  <p>The obſeruations from this verſe, are from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Paul,</hi> as an Apoſtle, or as a Chriſtian.</p>

                     <hi>Ob.</hi> If we conſider him as an Apoſtle, we obſerue; 1. That Miniſters are not only to preach againſt wicked perſons, &amp; to exhort their people to obedience, but alſo to pray for them, as <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Ieremy</hi> did.

                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:14442:131"/> 2. When Miniſters are to ſpeak of a matter that may diſtaſte; they muſt wiſely preuent all offence and grudge, by preparing the minds of the hearers, and ſhewing that they ſpeake not out of malice, but out of loue, and a deſire of their ſaluation. So <hi>Paul</hi> mitigates his reproofes, with proteſtations of his loue and gentleneſſe, which is no dawbing with vntempered mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<hi>Paul</hi> dawbed not, but had Gods Spirit when he ſpake to
<hi>Feſtus</hi> and <hi>Agrippa;</hi> and hauing reprooued the Galathians, Chap. 3. He affectionatly declares his loue, Chap. 4. As Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians prepare, and Nurſes ſometimes ſtill their little ones with ſinging: So alſo muſt Miniſters attempt euery way, which may profit their people.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Paul</hi> loues the Iewes, but tels them plainly of their faults: So muſt Miniſters doe. Indeed the way to get peace among men, is, not to reprooue; but this is the way to loſe the peace of God, and to bring the bloud of our hearers vpon our owne ſoules.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The condition of Miniſters is miſerable. The labour is great: the care to ſaue the ſoules of our hearers (yea our own) that we may giue vp a good account, is infinite; the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents not to be expreſſed: as, to ſpend many ſleepleſſe nights, many teares, and ſighes for their ſaluation, who raile and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile vs, accounting vs vnworthy to liue:</p>

<hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> obſerues, he reproues it vehemently and takes away all Apology from them.</p>
                  <p>Here then (I take it) the Apoſtle comes directly to point, to ſhew that Iuſtification by Faith aboliſheth not the Law, though their zeale bee caſt away; becauſe it was not according to knowledge:
<hi>Paul</hi> here notably in the firſt place, beating downe (as was fit) the admiration and opinion they had of their zealous obſeruations.</p>

                  <p>Zeale of God.

                  <p>This Rule is ſound knowledge out of Gods Word.</p>
                  <p>This knowledge muſt be three-fold. Firſt, of the thing of the which we are zealous, that it be in the Right. For if wee be in the wrong, the more zeale, the worſe; as in a wrong way, the more haſte the worſe ſpeed.

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:14442:133"/>heareſay and aduenture, but vpon certainty, being able out of the Word, ſoundly to conuince the ſame. For here is the indignation; and if there be not ſound knowledge, we may become ſlanderers of our brethren; and (as they ſay) beat them with the ſword, who deſerue not to be touched with the ſcabberd.</p>

                  <p>By this three-fold knowledge muſt our zeale be directed, where the Word begins, there muſt our zeale beginne, and where the Word ends, there muſt our zeale end, whatſoeuer our opinion be.

                  <p>There are two forts of men, hereby to be apprehended. 1. They which haue a deſect not of zeale, but of knowledge, for the ground of their zeale. 2. They which haue a defect not of knowledge, but of zeale anſwerable to their knowledge. Of the 1. of theſe may be verified the Prouerbe. They ſet the Cart before the Horſe. The ſecond may bee likened to
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> Chariots, when the wheeles were off: ſo ſlowly doe they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe their knowledge in their liues. The firſt are like a little ſhip without ballaſt &amp; fraught, but with a great many ſailes; which is ſoone either daſht againſt the Rockes, or toppled
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:14442:134"/>ouer; The ſecond, are like a goodly great Ship well ballaſted, and richly fraughted, but without any ſayles, which quickly falleth into the hands of Pyrats, becauſe it can make no ſpeed; ſooner making a prey for them, then a good Voyage for the Merchant.</p>
                  <p>Separate zeale and knowledge, and they become both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable: but wiſely ioyne them, and they perfect a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, being like a precious Diamond in a ring of Gold. Let not zeale outrunne knowledge or lagge behinde it; but let it <hi>ad aequale</hi> agree, going hand in hand with the ſame. For euen as in an Inſtrument of Muſike there is a proportion of ſound, wherein is the harmony, beyond which, if any ſtring be ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it makes a ſqueaking noyſe; and if it bee not ſtrained e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, it yeelds a clagging, dull and vnpleaſant ſound. So is it in our zeale, if it bee either more or leſſe then our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>Among the firſt ſort of theſe men which haue zeale, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledge, are to be placed the Iewes, and wee may iuſtly put the Papiſts, whoſe zeale for their many groundleſſe deuices, hath made them bloudy perſecutors of the Goſpell: Likewiſe the Browniſts, whoſe immoderate zeale without warrant, hath made them moſt vncharitable Cenſurers of all the famous Churches in Chriſtendome.</p>
                  <p>Among the other ſort which haue knowledge vvithout zeale, are our Dullerds in Religion, who are like a reſty horſe, that hath metall and ſtrength, but will not goe forward. Bee zealous and amend; the example of Laodicea were enough to prouoke vs.

                  <p>In this verſe then we haue two things, 1. A Iuſtification, That the Iewes are zealous, but not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: They are ignorant of the righteouſnes of God. 2.

                  <p>Here is a diſtinction of righteouſnes, it is two-fold; Firſt, Gods. Secondly, Our owne. Gods righteouſnes is not abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, but eſtabliſhed by faith.

                  <p>For they beeing ignorant of Gods righteouſneſſe; not whereby God is righteous in himſelfe, but which he giues to man, that he may be righteous by God.

                  <p>THe Iewes are zealous of the righteouſneſſe of the Lavv, yet are ignorant of Gods righteouſnes, and ſubmit not vnto it: for God gaue the Law, not to make vs righteous, but to make vs ſeeke Chriſt, the end of the Lavv, that wee might be righteous in him.</p>
                  <p>Here <hi>Paul</hi> brings an Argument, to ſhew that Iuſtification by faith, eſtabliſheth the righteouſneſſe of the Law. That which aimeth at, and attaineth the end of the Law, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it not: But faith attaineth the end of it, which is Chriſt. Therefore. And as hee which runneth not to the end of the race, miſſeth the prize; ſo the Iewes miſſe of Iuſtification, becauſe they haue not Chriſt, the end of the Law.</p>
                  <p>In this verſe are two things; 1. A Propoſition. 2. The am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification.</p>
                  <p>The Propoſition. Chriſt is the end of the Lavv, both Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall and Morall. The Iewes ſought to be righteous by the obſeruation of both theſe.</p>
                  <p>The end, The end of a thing is either Mathematicall or
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:14442:136"/>Morall. The Mathematicall end, is the vtmoſt part of a thing in which the length or continuance is determined; as a point is the end of a line, Death the end of life, the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the end of this vvorld.</p>
                  <p>The Morall end of a thing, is the ſcope and perfection of it.</p>
                  <p>Now Chriſt is the end of the Law both waies. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicall end, both of the Ceremoniall and Morall, but diuerſly. Of the Ceremoniall, by a direct ſignification of the Morall, by an accidentall direction. The Ceremonies ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Chriſt, and ended at him. The Morall Law alſo, after a ſort, leades to Chriſt. Properly, the Morall Law leades ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to the Curſe, but by account to Chriſt, as the diſeaſe leades to the medicine or Phyſician.</p>
                  <p>He is alſo the morall end of both. For hee is the body of thoſe Ceremonies and ſhadowes, and hee perfectly fulfilled the Decalogue for vs, and that three waies; 1. In his pure conception. 2. In his godly life.
3. In his holy and obedient ſufferings, and all for vs: for whatſoeuer the Law required that we ſhould Bee, Doe, or Suffer, hee hath performed in our behalfe. Therefore one wittily ſaith,

<hi>Telos,</hi> the end, or Tribute; and we by his payment, <hi>Ateleis,</hi> tribute-free; vve are diſcharged by him before God. Chriſt is both theſe ends; but principally the laſt is heere vnderſtood.</p>
                  <p>The Amplification is by a double determination: 1. For vvhat.
2. For vvhom. 1. For righteouſnes to be done, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted. This firſt, and more principally alſo, for the other. 2. For whom; Deſcribed 1. by quality, for Beleeuers. 2. By generality, Euery Beleeuer.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> In ſubſtance the righteouſneſſe of the Law and the Goſpell are all one. For none can be iuſtified by any other righteouſnes, then that which the Law requireth.

Therefore as when <hi>Ionas</hi> was caſt into the Sea, it calmed, ſo thy Conſcience may now be calmed by the death and Reſurrection of Chriſt, of whom <hi>Ionas</hi> was the Type.

                     </note> Confeſſion is three-fold. Of ſinnes, of Benefits, of the Truth: this laſt is here vnderſtood; namely, that mayne Truth, Saluation onely by Chriſt.

                  <p>In the 9. verſe, Confeſſion is ſet before: in this verſe, Faith. In Nature, and in the order of Compoſition, faith of the heart goes before confeſſion of the mouth;

                  <p n="2">2. The Reſtruction of the generall, Whoſoeuer belieueth. Whoſoeuer, concludes all Belieuers; Belieuers, excludes all vnbelieuers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The obiect of Faith, In him. To belieue on Chriſt, is not onely to belieue that Chriſt is, and that what he ſaith is true, but to reſt vpon his Righteouſnes for Iuſtification, and to truſt him with our Saluation, as <hi>Paul,</hi>

                     <hi>I knowe whom I haue belieued.</hi> On him, notes Faith and Confidence.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The effect of Faith, Not aſhamed; The contrary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied for the direct effect. As if he had ſaid, Shall be ſaued. For the denying of one contrary, is the affirming of the other. They ſhall not be fruſtrate of their end; therefore not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But wee account it a good thing to be aſhamed, and the contrary a fault. <hi>Diogenes</hi> thus incouraged a young man bluſhing, Feare not, it is Vertues colour. Yet the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers wiſely diſtinguiſh of it, counting it a grace in young folkes; but old folkes ſhould commit nothing which might make them bluſh.</p>

                  <p>This alſo comforts againſt the guiltineſſe of ſinne, which is the true cauſe of ſhame, following it as the ſhadow doth the body. How profane wee were before our conuerſion, and how weakely we haue walked ſince, our conſcience knowes and is aſhamed. Here is our helpe, faith obtaines pardon of ſinne, and therefore we ſhall neuer bee put to ſhame for our faults: we are ſinners; but as when the light comes, the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe departs, and the more light, the leſſe darkneſſe: ſo faith driues away ſhame, and the more wee beleeue, the leſſe doe we feare confuſion and ſhame. <hi>Peter</hi> walked vpon the water and ſhamed himſelfe, for he began to ſinke.

A childe cannot take vp his meate ſo ſtrongly, nor eate ſo much as doth a man, yet that little which he takes weakely and eates, nouriſheth him, as well as more meat doth a man. So though thou be but a child in Faith, thy Faith ſhal ſaue thee, as wel as
<hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith ſaued him. For a man is not ſaued by the quantitie of his Faith, but by the preciouſneſſe of that which Faith receiues, which is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt, which a weake and little Faith will as ſauingly apprehend as a ſtrong Faith; as a Begger that hath a ſhaking weake hand, can make ſhift to take an almes, as well as he that hath not ſuch infirmitie.</p>

                  <p>The Minor is affirmed in the firſt part of this verſe, and confirmed in the reſt of it from the ſuffering of God.</p>
                  <p>There is no difference betweene the Iew and the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian: The Iewes were the poſteritie of <hi>Sem,</hi> by <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and
<hi>Iacob,</hi> inhabiting in the land of Canaan, a part of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria in Aſia.

So called, becauſe they were the moſt famous for their learning and bringing vp, in reſpect of which, they called all other Barbarians.</p>
                  <p>It appeares then that there is a great difference betweene a Iew and a Grecian, in regard of Anceſtors, Countrey, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, Manners, &amp;c. But <hi>Paul</hi> meanes none of theſe: but is to be vnderſtood onely of Iuſtification; in regard of which, there is no difference betweene them, that a man ſhould euer the more or leſſe be iuſtified or ſaued, becauſe hee is a Iew or Grecian.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the ſame Lord ouer all:</hi> Here is the Confirmation: All <pb n="273" facs="tcp:14442:144"/>are ſeruants to the ſame Lord. It is not to bee forgotten, that his Maieſties Tranſlation hath exceedingly amended the reading in this place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Is rich vnto all:</hi> Becauſe he powreth out an exhauſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of goodneſſe vpon vs, well may he be ſaid to be rich, if we conſider what manner of things he beſtowes, how great, with what bounty, and how many.</p>

                     <hi>To all:</hi> Not hand ouer head: not to euery particular, but to them that call on him: Not that ſay Lord haue mercy: but that call in Faith. Here is the ſufficiencie of God: <hi>Hee is rich to all,</hi> and the Indigencie of man, <hi>that call vpon,</hi> or begge of Him.</p>
                  <p>Many collect here two Arguments, to proue there is no difference; but indeed there are three. The firſt, There is the ſame Lord. The ſecond, He is rich to all. The Iewes neede not grutch the comming in of the Gentiles, they ſhall not haue the leſſe, for GOD is able to enrich all: as the Sunne, though it euery day giue his light, and men and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures partake of it: yet neither hath It, or We the leſſe; ſo though thouſands from one end of the earth to the other, flocke to the receiuing of Mercy, yet God hath ſtore, and the fountaine is aboue our Thirſt.

                  </p>
                  <p>The occaſion of <hi>Ioels</hi> ſpeech was this: There was a great famine in Iewry: the Cauſe, their ſinnes: the meanes; Firſt, a great raine preſently after Seede time: after that a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful drought. Alſo God ſent Graſhoppers and Caterpillers, &amp;c. which deuoured the little encreaſe which the earth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> Argument is thus framed: If whoſoeuer call on God ſhall be ſaued: then is God rich to all that call on him, for no riches are comparable to ſaluation. But the firſt is true. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laſt.</p>
                  <p>In this verſe are two things. Firſt, the Duty. Secondly, the Euent. The Duty, Calling vpon God. The euent, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>

                  <p>SAint <hi>Paul</hi> hath before ſpoken of Faith, and the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of it: and ſome thinke that here his purpoſe is to ſhew the meanes to come to Faith, which is, by hearing the Word.

                  <p>The Apoſtle ſaid, that vvhoſoeuer, Iew or Gentile calles vpon God, ſhall be ſaued. Hence hee inferreth that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell muſt be preached to the Gentiles. The Argument is thus:

                        <item> But without the Goſpel they cannot be ſaued,</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt Propoſition is auouched before; the Minor is in theſe verſes proued, where wee haue the Argument it ſelfe, verſe 14. and part of the 15. with the 17.

                     <hi>How ſhall they beleeue, &amp;c.</hi> That is, they cannot beleeue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearing, which is the ordinary and high-way to Faith.

He that is borne deafe, is alſo borne dumbe. The reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we learne to ſpeake. Deafe men are barred from Faith and ſaluation, to be attained by hearing, but not ſimply and abſolutely, becauſe God when he pleaſeth, can extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worke Faith without the ſenſes. Wee haue ſome Notions of God left in Nature; but to know God in Chriſt, and things to be beleeued vnto ſaluation, comes from without, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Inſtruction.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>How can they preach, except they be ſent?</hi> That is, None can Preach, except they be ſent. A man vnſent may debate or diſcourſe of matters, but not as the Embaſſadors of God, to the begetting of Faith, except they bee ſent of God.</p>
                  <p>If a man take vpon him to preach not being ſent, hee were as good hold his peace. As a priuate mans doings running on an Embaſſy of his owne head, are not approued of the King: ſo good workes onely with them whom he ſendeth. He that begets Faith in any, is ſent of God.</p>

                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:14442:150"/>The proofe is taken out of
<hi>Eſay,</hi> chap. 52.7. From the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the preaching of the Goſpell, which is ioy and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in them which heard it. So at Antioch there was great ioy; ſo in Galatia, and in diuers Cities and Townes it was entertained as with clapping of hands, which ioyfull imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of it, proues it to be of Gods ſending.</p>
                  <p>This effect is ſet forth vnder a Compariſon of the leſſe; for <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeakes of the Royall receiuing of the Meſſengers of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels deliuerance from the captiuitie of Babylon, of vvhich when News came, they were ſo rauiſhed, &amp; filled with laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they thought it had not beene a truth, but a dreame. If then the tidings of ſuch temporall deliuerance was ſo wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, much more muſt be welcome the glad tidings of the Goſpell: and as thoſe meſſengers were from God, ſo much more theſe, it being a great deale more likely that the Iewes might be deliuered from that bodily ſeruitude, then that the world ſhould be deliuered from the bondage of Satan, by the bloud of God.</p>
                  <p>In theſe words are two things. Firſt, a commendation of the Goſpell; <hi>How beautifull, &amp;c!</hi>

Some interpret the velocitie of the Apoſtles in conuerting the world. Some their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie and courage. Some take beauty for the holineſſe of the Apoſtles; ſome for a fleſhly beauty by ornaments, as ſlippers imbroidered with Gold and Pearle; as this Scripture is abuſed to the conſecrating of the Popes toe. But the plaine meaning is, that the comming of the Apoſtles with the glad tidings of ſaluation was acceptable: he ſaith, <hi>feet,</hi> becauſe they are the inſtruments of going; as wee familiarly ſay of poore men.

Neuer merry vvorld (ſay ſome) ſince wee had ſo much preaching; as if the Sun ſhone too bright. Like the Iſraelites, who ſtumbled at the plenty of Manna. Theſe are a kinne to thoſe Diuels, who asked Chriſt if he were come to torment them. So they account the Goſpell a torment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it croſſeth their profane, couetous, and Epicure-like courſes. Theſe can ſpend daies and nights in vanitie, but an houre at a Sermon is tedious. Bleare-eyed <hi>Leah</hi> is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their eye, then <hi>Rachel.</hi> The Onions of Egypt haue a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reliſh in their mouthes, then Manna and Quailes. They had rather liue at the Hogs-trough (for what are all worldly pleaſures, but draffe in compariſon?) then in their fathers houſe. Preferring their pigges with the
<hi>Gadarenes,</hi> before our Sauiour Chriſt. O, ſay they, We cannot liue by Sermons. But alas! what are all pleaſures without this? euen vanity &amp; vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of ſpirit: yea, the more of theſe, the more torment to the conſcience at the day of death, when the Goſpel of peace is worth all the world.</p>
                  <p>But whats the cauſe we loue the Goſpel no better? Surely this, we know not our own poore eſtate, and ſo are ignorant of the worth of it. If we knew theſe, wee would runne from Eaſt to Weſt for it. If drunkards, and the rabble of vvicked wretches knew their fearefull eſtate, the Miniſter ſhould be as welcome to them, as bread to the hungry, or a pardon to a Theefe.</p>
                  <p>To them which are viſited in their conſciences, is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell ſweet, but to them which are hardned, it hath no ſauor. Poore ſoules! If a man in the ſtreet cry fire, fire, euery man runnes; but we daily cry the fire of Hell to conſume all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinners, yet none almoſt are moued. Whats that fire to this? What the burning of rotten houſes, to the burning of body and ſoule in fire and brimſtone for euer?</p>
                  <p>If the Lord would be pleaſed but to ſhew a wicked man the torments of Hell, or to viſite his conſcience with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:14442:152"/>of his wrath, then the very crummes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell would be welcome, when now they lothe the full meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Conſolation. Then, to ſee the ſweetnes of but one ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or line in the Goſpell, would be more acceptable then the whole riches of the world. When the Conſcience is wounded, and the Diuell ſtrongly accuſeth, then how beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull will the feet be of the now contemned Miniſters of the Goſpell? Sell all thy profits, pleaſures, ſinnes, to purchaſe this treaſure of peace which comes by the Goſpel. Many are daily cheapning, but they vnderbid for it, they would faine haue it, but are driuen away with the price, becauſe it requires a forſaking of all to follow Chriſt. But indeed,
<hi>Daniels</hi> fare with the Goſpel, is a roiall feaſt: if thou accounteſt not ſo, thou haſt a proud, and an ignorant heart.</p>

                  <p>IN this verſe <hi>Paul</hi> preuents an Obiection, againſt that which was ſaid concerning the preaching of the Goſpel to the Gentiles, that it was of God. As if ſome Iew ſhould ſay: No, <hi>Paul,</hi> God neuer ſent you to preach to them; for if hee had, he would haue ſent you firſt to vs, and haue bleſſed your labours: but the greater part obey you not, either of Iewes or Gentiles. It may be, here and there a few of the common ſort follow you: but where are the great Rabbines, the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes? The fourth part follow you not, but perſecute you. Therfore, becauſe this buſines profits not in your hands, God neuer ſent you, but you runne of your own head.</p>
                  <p>This was a plauſible Argument to the Iewes, to vvhich
<hi>Paul</hi> anſwers by a Conceſsion, with a Correction annexed: as if he ſhould ſay, Indeed all doe not obey the Goſpel; yet you Iewes are not to be offended; becauſe, as our ſending vvas fore-told, ſo your and their incredulitie; and the ſmall fruit and effect was fore-told alſo.</p>
                  <p>In this verſe we note two parts; 1. A declaration of the ſucceſſe of the preaching of the Goſpel, Not all obey it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a Confirmation of it out of <hi>Eſay.</hi>

The effect is put for the cauſe: ſo we ſay of the trees in our Orchards: this is a Peare, that a plum, when they are the trees that beare ſuch fruit: ſo Faith is the tree that beares the fruit of obedience.</p>
                  <p>This obedience of Faith is two-fold; Firſt, or Reaſon: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of Works.</p>
                  <p>That of Reaſon is, when it giues place and way to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, though it conceiue it not.

                  <p>In this <hi>Paul</hi> preuents another obiection, occaſioned by the words before, concerning the ſending of the Goſpell to the Gentiles, as if ſome Iew ſhould haue ſayd:</p>

                     <hi>Paul</hi> anſweres, that they doe and ſhall preach to them all; which he vtters by an interrogation, and proues by a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny out of the Pſalmes; as if he ſhould ſay: <hi>Dauid</hi> tells you that all haue, or might heare; for, Their ſound is gone out into all the earth.</p>
                  <p>Queſtion is whether <hi>Paul</hi> alleadge this teſtimony, or allude vnto it: In the Pſalme he ſpeaks of works, here of the Word. Some ſay that <hi>Paul</hi> argues from the leſſe: If God teach all by the great volume of the heauens, much more will he teach all, by the heauenly doctrine of the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>I thinke that vnder the hiſtoricall narration of the heauens, and of their ſound, is hid a prophecy of the preaching of the Goſpell, becauſe the latter part of the Pſalme ſpeakes much in the commendation of it; and <hi>Paul</hi> here ſo applies it. And indeed there is a moſt ſweet Analogie, betweene the heauens ſound and the Goſpell. There are diuers particulars obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: I thinke theſe are good:</p>
                  <p>The heauens are the worke of Gods hand; ſo is the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell reuealed by God. The heauens ſhew the worke of God: ſo the Goſpell, that wee are Iuſtified by the worke of God, which is faith, not by the works of man. The doctrine of the Goſpell is pure and lightſome as are the heauens. The influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the heauens comforteth &amp; cheriſheth inferior things; ſo doth the Goſpell the Conſcience. The diuerſity of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Languages is manifold which vnderſtand not one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; yet all vnderſtand the excellency of the heauens, and the wonderfull worke of God in them. So God enabled the Apoſtles to teach all Nations in their owne tongues the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull works of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Into all the earth, and vnto the ends of the world:</hi> The ſumme is, that the Goſpell was preached to all the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But many Nations were long after the Apoſtles dayes conuerted: as England in the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the great; the Iaponians and Americans but the other day heard of Chriſt.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> All the earth is either taken for the moſt part; &amp; the ends, for Countries very farre off: or it is ſpoken of that which ſhould be; or it is meant of the 4. quarters of the world; or of the Romane Empire.

From the Inſtruments which God vſeth to anger and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke them withall: Namely, <hi>No people: A fooliſh Nation.</hi> That is, the Gentiles; whom the Iewes accounted beaſts, and not men, euen dogges.</p>
                  <p>As a man diuorcing an adulterous wife, and in her face taking her bondmaid to be his wife, and adorning her with the garments and iewels of his former wife, muſt needs make her pine with enuy &amp; ielouſie: So God threatens the Iewes, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had choſen to be his Spouſe, that he would caſt them off for their wickednes, and beſtow their priuiledges on the Gentiles. Or as a Mother, ſometimes for a fault done by her little one, thruſts it from her, and ſaith it ſhall be her child no longer, taking vp a ſtrangers child into her lap: ſo doth God threaten the Iewes.

<hi>Paul</hi> enters into the ſchooles, propounds his poſition. His aduerſarie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares and oppoſeth. <hi>Paul</hi> takes his argument, anſwers it, and plainly makes good his anſwer by Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The poſition is, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Eſay</hi> haue fore-prophecied the reiection of the Iewes, as in the tenth Chap. ver.
19.20.21.</p>
                  <p>The Repliers argument (ſuppoſe a Iew) is this: If they be ſo to be vnderſtood, then God hath caſt away his people. But the laſt is falſe, therefore the firſt.</p>
                  <p>This argument is in theſe words, <hi>I demaund then, Hath God caſt away his people?</hi> propounded by way of queſtion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> anſwer to the queſtion, is in all the reſt of the words, to verſe 11. Firſt, by a ſtrong negation. Secondly, by a ſpecial inſtance. Thirdly, by an accurate diſtinction. Fourthly, by an elegant ſimilitude. Fiftly, by a graue determination, fortified by euident Scriptures, which he alwayes hath in a readineſſe as a ſacred anchor to ſtay vs from being caried about with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery wind or waue of doctrine.</p>
                  <p>The two firſt parts of this anſwer are in the firſt verſe. The firſt is in the negation, in theſe words, <hi>God forbid. Paul</hi> denies with indignation and defiance; as if he ſhould ſay: Farre be it from me to teach that God ſhould caſt away his people whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; or that all the Iewes, or that a Iew, becauſe a Iew, ſhould be reiected of God.</p>

He leaues not the matter ſo, but declares that (neuertheleſſe) there is a doore of mercie open to all of them that will beleeue: as if he ſhould ſay: It is true, God is angrie with the Iewes, and hath caſt them away, but let none deſpaire; for ſo many as repent, ceaſſing to blaſpheme Chriſt, and ſhall beleeue in him, ſhall be ſaued. This courſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> muſt be a patterne for Miniſters: they muſt preach iudgements, and denounce the curſe againſt ſinners,

                  <p>To preach alwayes the curſe and damnation, is a butcherly kind of preaching: otherwiſe doth the butcher conſider the ſheepe, otherwiſe the ſhepheard: the butcher to kill it, the ſhepheard to keepe and ſaue it.

                  <p>Indeed I maruell not, that the Papiſts teach, we cannot be ſure, when they rely vpon Traditions as well as Scriptures, and hold all are iuſtified morally by inherent righteouſneſſe: and therefore becauſe of the mutabilitie of our wils, their aſſurance muſt needs be but morall, which may be otherwiſe. Their doctrine is moſt vncomfortable. He that calleth vpon God, ſhall be ſaued; but he that prayeth doubting, obtaineth nothing. The Papiſts pray for ſaluation, and doubt: how then can they haue it? I am. 1.6.7. by which place it manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, that a doubting faith is not a ſauing faith. We reade of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Pſalmes,

To liue wickedly, and to haue a prophane heart, contemning all goodneſſe, makes men ſure indeed, but of damnation: but he which beleeues and repents, is as ſure euen now of ſaluation, as if euen now hewere reigning with Chriſt in heauen.</p>

<hi>Paule</hi> diſtinguiſheth of this terme <hi>(his people)</hi> which is taken two wayes: ae quiuocally, in a large ſence; and vniuocally, in a more reſtrained ſence: people which are not fore-knowne, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which are fore-knowne: that is not elect, and elect. The firſt God caſts away: the ſecond he neuer will caſt away.</p>
                  <p>This then is <hi>Paules</hi> meaning. Whoſoeuer are borne in the Church, outwardly ſubmitting themſelues to the word and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, are in a generall ſence the people of God; of whom ſome onely ſeeme to beleeue, but doe not: theſe God caſts away.

Though the Iewes in regard of the outward things of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, were counted the people of God, yet he acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not thoſe which beleeue not; neither purpoſes to ſaue them. A Iew not beleeuing is as far from ſaluation (in regard of hauing it) as an Infidell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which he foreknew:</hi> There is a knowledg attributed to God, whereby he knowes all things, euen ſuch things which never ſhalbe.

                  <p>There is a knowledge alſo which is ioyned with his decree, and that either going before it, or following it. Things are from the firſt: the ſecond is from things. The firſt is the <pb n="8" facs="tcp:14442:165"/>of things, the ſecond is the effect. Of the ſecond is to be vnderſtood the ſaying; That the praeſcience of God cauſeth not things to be: for in this foreknowledge, things are, and therefore they are foreſeene. I know the ſunne will riſe; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know it doth the ſunne riſe, but contrarily. As our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of things paſt, is not the cauſe that they are paſt: ſo Gods foreknowledg of things to come in this ſecond ſence is not the cauſe that they ſhall come. This is nor heere ment.</p>
                  <p>The foreknowledge ioyned with the decree, but going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it,
<note place="margin">Act. 2.23.</note> is the cauſe of things: and this is either largely taken, for the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: by which foreknowledg Chriſt was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or more narrowly forelection; &amp; ſo foreknowledge is here to be vnderſtood; and therefore Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> read it, whom he predeſtinated, and ſo <hi>Anſelme</hi> expounds it: ſo doth the word implye, by an Hebraiſme, ſignifiing knowledg with loue and care;
<hi>God knoweth his</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paule</hi>) and our Sauiour to the wicked, <hi>I know you not.</hi> He knowes them well enough, but not ſo as to open Heauen gates for them.</p>

                  <p>There are two things whereby we may diſcerne whether our zeale exceed due limits and bounds or no: 1 If thou make thy ſelfe a partie, ſo much is it in the wrong. <hi>Elias</hi> was the more hot, becauſe his owne life was in danger: So if there be a diſordered perſon who hath prouoked vs, then wee crie its pitie but he ſhould be preſented, indited, puniſhed. But when vnder a colour of zeale againſt ſinne, we reuenge our owne wrongs; its more paſſion then zeale.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. Zeale ſhould conſume the faults not the perſons of offenders, if thine feeds on the perſons not on the faults, its naught. Quench it againſt the perſon, inflame it againſt the fault.
<hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> would haue had the wicked <hi>Samaritans</hi> by and by to be conſumed with fier from heauen: but they are reproued by our Sauiour.
<note place="margin">Luc. 9.53.</note> And here <hi>Elias</hi> was ſomewhat faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: comming ſhort of <hi>Moſes</hi> and

<hi>Eliah,</hi> are to be imitated of Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>Its a lamentable thing to ſee a father wringing of his hands ouer his child and complaining of his ſtubborneſſe, wiſhing he had neuer bene borne. So it is very greeuious to heare an <hi>Eliah</hi> complaine to God of the ſtubborneſſe of his people. We are your fathers: ſo liue you, that we may haue no cauſe to ſue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, either in the court of heauen or earth, but rather to reioyce oueryou, which we ſhall doe with much cheerefullnes praying for you if you forſake your ſinnes, and turne vnto God, obeying his word. If we in our prayers haue cauſe to complaine of you, it will be vnprofitable to you: for what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Eliah</hi> his complaint? The Lord ſpeakes to him as if hee ſhould ſay: <hi>Eliah</hi> I ſee thou art in a moode; well: goe annoynt <hi>Hazael</hi> King of <hi>Aram, Iehu</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> Prophet in thy roome: him that ſcapeth the ſword of <hi>Hazaell</hi> ſhall <hi>Iehu</hi>

Now I beſeech you, preſently to reforme your liues, that wee may mutually ioyne together to bleſſe God, you for vs, and we for you, that we may be all crowned together at the comming of Chriſt.</p>

<hi>Ahab</hi> could not come <pb n="18" facs="tcp:14442:170"/>by the Altar at Ieruſalem, being out of his Kingdome: What Alter then meanes <hi>Ahab?</hi>

<hi>Eliah</hi> his paralogiſme, which ſerues <hi>Paules</hi> purpoſe.
<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> did thus argue.</p>
                  <p>The Church which is not quite extinguiſhed, hath markes whereby it might be diſcerned.</p>
                  <p>But I (ſayth <hi>Eliah</hi>) diſcerne no ſuch in
<hi>Iſraell:</hi> therefore.</p>
                  <p>Thou doeſt not <hi>Eliah:</hi> what art thou? But I doe (ſayth the Lord) know the heart, and who are Iewes within. I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
7000 as good as thy ſelfe, who haue not bowed their knees to
<hi>Baal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7000. Some curiouſly ſpeake of this number: but a number certaine is put for an vncertaine. By 7000 ſayth one, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſumme of theſe who dealt worthily in not conſenting to idolatry is expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Seuen thouſand men, that is, men and woemen noted by the more worthy ſex.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I haue reſerued to my ſelfe.</hi> That is: though I haue ſuffered many to fall away, yet I haue reſerued to my owne vſe ſeuen thouſand. <hi>I haue reſerued:</hi> he ſaith not, here are left me ſome, by chance or at a venture, or by <hi>Ahabs, Ieſabels,</hi> and the diuels courteſie. Nor ſome haue reſerued themſelues; but <hi>I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued:</hi> as <hi>ver.</hi> 5. A reſeruation is made, not a few, but ſeuen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand: not ſome, which were then Idolaters, and after to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, or Infants that had no reaſon, but <hi>men that haue not bowed to Baal,</hi> but ſincerely worſhipped me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Who haue not bowed the knee,</hi> that is (by a figure) wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in the leaſt ſigne, as making a leg. It is added in the booke of Kigns, <hi>nor bleſſed him;</hi> by which it appeares, that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14442:172"/>the Iſraelites when they came to their Images, did both bow, and kiſſe their Images; as the Papiſts when they come by a Croſſe or Crucifix, put off their hats, make a legge, and alſo kiſſe ſome part of their Idols, beſides the Popes toe. Thus in <hi>Hoſee</hi> the Idolaters ſay,
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 13.2.</note>
                     <hi>Let them kiſſe the Calues:</hi> ſo <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Iob. 31.26.27.</note>
                     <hi>When I beheld the Sun or Moone, if my mouth did kiſſe my hand,</hi> &amp;c. as the Heathen which worſhipped the Sunne, becauſe they could not kiſſe it, kiſſed their hand, which was abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Idolatry. <hi>Kiſſe the Sonne,</hi> ſaith <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 2.12.</note> that is, <hi>worſhip him.</hi> So Emperours haue their knees, Kings their hands kiſſed in token of ſubiection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To Baal:</hi> that is, <hi>To the Image of Baal.</hi> So was the god of the Sydonians called. The word is good in the ſignification, for it is as much as Lord, or Husband; ſo they that worſhipped it, declared thereby that, that they were vaſſals, and bound to ſubiection to it, as the wife to the husband: and therefore is Idolatry called fornication.
<hi>Baal</hi> is of the Maſculine gender, and the Article prepoſed is of the Feminine, implying the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, as it is heere well ſupplied. And heere we may find the Papiſts tardie, making many <hi>Baals</hi> maſculine and feminine, and bowing to their Images, which hence appeares to be flat Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>Now in theſe words two things are to bee conſidered, the Summe of them, and the Circumſtances: who are two. Firſt, the Author of this Reſeruation. Secondly, a deſcription of the Reſerued.</p>

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 3.</note> Nor multitude, nor viſibility are certaine notes of the true Church: for then there had beene no Church in <hi>Eliah</hi> his time in Iſrael: for the multitude was with
<hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Ieſabel,</hi> and <hi>Eliah</hi> could not diſcerne one beſide himſelf, yet there were ſeuen thouſand.</p>
                  <p>The Papiſts ſay the Church was alwaies actually viſible to mans eye. Nay, they ſay that the Catholike Church is alwaies viſible: but the Creed confuteth them; for we beleeue the holy Catholike Church. It is beleeued, therefore not ſeene; diſcerned by faith, not by ſenſe But they anſwere that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe is inuiſible, not the Catholikeneſſe. Indeede the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their Church cannot be ſeene; neither can the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likeneſſe, <hi>qua talis,</hi> no more then the ſubſtances of things can be diſcerned with the eye.</p>
                  <p>If they had ſaid that particular Churches are alwayes viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they had ſaid ſomewhat, and yet heere, ſome cautions are to be remembred: It is alwayes viſible <hi>potentiâ,</hi> but not
<hi>actu.</hi> It is ſimply in it ſelfe viſible, though in ſome reſpect it may be inuiſible, which reſpect is threefold. Firſt, of place: As the Sunne is alwaies viſible, but to vs then only, when it ariſeth in our Hemiſphere. So at Ieruſalem the Church is not to be ſeene, when it remoued to Pella. Secondly, of the Time, as of perſecution, as in <hi>Eliah</hi> his time, and in Queene <hi>Maries</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:14442:173"/>dayes, when the Church was faine to flye into the wilderneſſe. As the Sunne, behinde a cloud in ſome reſpect is inuiſible, ſo may it be ſaid of a Church. Thirdly, of perſons which ſhould diſcerne it, for a Church is ſometimes inuiſible, not through the fault of the Church, but of mens eyes, which are eyther weake eyes, as of
<hi>Eliah,</hi> or blinde eyes, as of them which hate the Church. If
<hi>Eliah</hi> had rubbed his eyes, and cleared them from their dimneſſe, occaſioned by feare and anger, he might haue diſcerned ſeuen thouſand. And it is the nature of hatred to put out the eyes of them which are poſſeſſed with it, that they can no more diſcerne any good thing in their oppoſites, then a blinde man can ſee the Sunne.</p>
                  <p>The Papiſts ſay, that the Church is as a houſe ſet vpon a hill: True, but the toppe of the hill may be couered with a cloud, and ſo a while vnſeene, and though the cloud be gone, yet eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eye cannot diſcerne it. He that cannot ſee the hill, can much leſſe ſee the houſe on the top of it.</p>

                  <p>THeſe words (as was before ſaid) are an amplificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſumme of the 5. verſ. namely, that the Reſeruation is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to election of Grace: from whence this Conſectary takes place. If by election of grace, then not by workes.</p>
                  <p>Though this doe not much pertaine to <hi>Pauls</hi> Argument in hand, yet by the direction of the Spirit he takes that little oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion offered, to ſpeake ſomething in commendation of Grace, becauſe he had to deale with the Iewes, which ſtood greatly vpon their owne Righteouſneſſe; which indeed was <pb n="30" facs="tcp:14442:176"/>one of their maine diſeaſes; and therefore he neglects not by the way to touch this ſort, and to giue them a iog for remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, that we are ſaued by grace, not by workes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> example muſt teach Miniſters a point of wiſedome; which is, to take notice of the ſpeciall ſinnes of their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and in the courſe of their teaching, if any occaſion offer, though it lie not ſo plaine in their way, to giue them a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> breakes out here into a new queſtion, that he might meete with the Iewes in euery corner. When Miniſters ſpeake againſt the ſinnes of their Auditors: O, ſay they, he findes not that in his text; but we know, by the direction of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and by the warrant of
<hi>Pauls</hi> example, if we find ſuch in you, how to find it in our text to reproue you for it, and yet not to be guiltie of rouing or digreſſing.</p>
                  <p>But to the Conſectary. If election and preſeruation be of grace, it is not of workes. This is proued by the nature of grace and workes, which are contrary, and deſtroy one another. And it is ſet downe with inuerſion of the termes. That which is of grace, is not of workes; elſe grace were not grace (that is, free:) That which is of workes, is not of grace; elſe works were not workes, that is, did not make indebted.</p>
                  <p>The myſterie in this verſe plainly appeares, if we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what is meant by grace, and what by workes.</p>
                  <p>The Schoolemen and Ieſuites diſtinguiſh grace, into grace making gracious, and grace freely giuen.

<hi>art.</hi> 1.</note> The firſt, they ſay, is charitie, a grace whereby we are conioyned to God: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is faith, and the reſt of Chriſtian vertues. But firſt, both theſe are coincident, for charitie alſo is a grace freely giuen. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they make this grace to be in man; they know no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and therefore <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and the reſt, when they write of this ſubiect, they write <hi>de gratia hominis,</hi> of the grace of man: but the Scripture onely ſpeaketh of the grace of God, and of the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Grace is taken three wayes: Firſt, for the free fauour of God, the alone cauſe of our election, which is ſubiectiuely in God, one of the imminent vertues of the Deitie, being his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. This is meant here.</p>

                     </note> the leſuites call it, an helpe, or grace preuenting, or following: of grace preuenting, is that place, Eph. 2.8. of following 1. Cor.
15.10. of both together, 2. Cor. 12.9.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for the gifts of grace, which haue a different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation ordinarily in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, as faith, hope, loue, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; and this is diſtributed into habituall grace and actuall. This in no wiſe is here to be vnderſtood, nor either of the parts before ſpoken of from the Schoole. For charitie and faith are workes; but we muſt haue a grace oppoſite to workes.</p>
                  <p>Workes are either good or bad: bad workes not here vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, but good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But grace and good workes are agreeing as the cauſe and the effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> To ſpeake properly, the anger of God is contrary to his grace: and vnto workes, are no workes, or bad workes contrary. So that the contrarietie here to be holden is not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but in the caſe of iuſtification and ſaluation. Vnderſtand not here, workes themſelues, but the merit of workes. and yet not the merit of all workes, (as Chriſts) but of Our workes. And then the rule of contraries here takes place, that one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put, the other is taken away. The nature of grace is to be free, the nature of workes to be of due debt: ſo that if it be free, it is not of debt, elſe were grace no grace: if it be of due debt, it is not free, elſe were workes no more workes.</p>
                  <p>The legerdemaine of the Papiſts is here to be noted, who leaue and wipe out the laſt halfe of this verſe, <hi>And if of workes, then not of grace, elſe workes are no more workes,</hi> blaſphemouſly ſaying that it is ſuperfluuos. But we can eaſily ſpie out the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this their doing, namely becauſe their doctrine of merit is hereby ingulated. As they haue dealt with the bookes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writers, ſo haue they attempted here, purging and curtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling off that which makes againſt them. And then they would make vs beleeue that their abſurd vulgar Tranſlation is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecter then the originall Greeke text it ſelfe.

                  <p n="2">2 Their ſecond euaſion is, that ſaluation is of grace indeed, but alſo of workes, making a mingle-mangle of grace and workes, which is as if a man ſhould attempt to make fire and water agree. But Saint
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> takes away this in a word: <hi>Grace</hi> (ſaith he)

                  <p>The Diuels prime deſire is to draw thee to abominable courſes; if he cannot preuaile this way, but thou wilt be doing good workes; this will pleaſe him, if thou wilt be conceited of meriting thereby.

                  </p>
                  <p>The naturall meaning may well be retained: Dead ſleepe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14442:180"/>being called Compunction by a figure, the effect for the cauſe, becauſe much or no Compunction can awake it, or rather of the cauſe for the effect, becauſe Compunction is the cauſe of dead ſleepe (not in the body, but) in the minde.</p>
                  <p>There is a double Compunction of minde; one comming from ſorrow for ſinne, as that, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. another comming from Enuie and Malice, which was in the Iewes, becauſe the Goſpell of Chriſt, whom they crucified, was preached and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in the world: this was as a dagger at their hearts. This Compunction of Enuie is heere meant, which is the cauſe of ſuch a deadneſſe of mind, that as a man in a dead ſleep heares and vnderſtands nothing: ſo a mind poſſeſſed with Enuy, is not patient to heare or conceiue any thing, for its good. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of griefe brings a failing of the mind: Now enuy is a gnawing of the heart againſt our neighbour. When <hi>Stephen</hi> preached,
<note place="margin">Act. 7.</note> the Iewes gnaſh their teeth, ſtoppe their eares, their hearts being readie to burſt for anger and rage. And when <hi>Paul</hi> preaches at Antiochia,
<note place="margin">Act. 13.48.</note> the Iewes raile, contradict, and ſtirre vp perſecution, ſo that a man had as good ſpeak to a wall or a dead man, as vnto them. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> expounds it, as a nayling to their paſſion, wherby they are vnmoueable in their perfidiouſneſſe.

                  <p>This Iudgement is amplified by foure Arguments. 1. The Cauſe. 2. The Effect, 3. The Subiect. 4. The Adiunct.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Cauſe is two-fold, firſt Principal, God the Author of this Compunction, not as it is a ſinne, but as it is a iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſecondly, Inſtrumentall, Satan: therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The ſpirit of ſlumber:</hi> not as God workes grace in his owne, doth he worke this blindneſſe in the reprobate, but grace by himſefe, blindneſſe by Satan: to whom concerning ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, God ſpeaketh as it were thus: Satan, is ſuch a one ſo wretched, that he enuies the Goſpell, and ſpets at it? Take <pb n="40" facs="tcp:14442:181"/>him to thee, torment him for it, harden him more, that his condemnation may be the greater. God is the Iudge: Satan the tormentor,: by the ſpirit of ſlumber is alſo meant the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible working of Satan vpon our corrupt nature, as if a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the top of an hill, and purpoſing to runne downe, the Diuell ſhould ſtand at his backe and puſh him forward.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Effect, <hi>Eyes that they ſhould not ſee,</hi> &amp;c. Blindneſſe of minde, not to be capable of ſauing knowledge, is an effect of malice againſt the truth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Subiect, <hi>The Iewes,</hi> a wiſe and learned people in the Law.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Adiunct, <hi>To this Day,</hi> which may be referred to the ſeuenth verſe, Hardened, or blinded to this day: it is all one; the meaning, not for euer, but to this day. The vaile vnto this day is layd ouer their hearts, but it ſhall be taken away.

                  <p>HEre is the other teſtimonie, which is <hi>Dauids,</hi> where it is auouched that the multitude of the Iewes are hardened, and blinded, and by conſequence caſt off.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> propheſies of this in the 69 Pſalme, ver.
21, 22, 23. <hi>Paul</hi> ties not himſelfe to the very words of the Pſalme, but being guided by the ſame Spirit by which <hi>Dauid</hi> wrote, addes and alters ſome words, without diminiſhing of the ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> began that Pſalme with grieuous complaints againſt <pb n="24" facs="tcp:14442:182"/>his owne enemies: but the Spirit turnes his meditations vpon the enemies of Chriſt, whom he curſeth; foretelling what cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie and outrage they ſhould commit, and what they ſhould ſuffer for it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two verſes containe an imprecation, where we haue three things: firſt, the matter of it: ſecondly, the perſons: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The matter is twofold: firſt, he curſes them in good things, ver. 9. Secondly, he wiſhes euill things vnto them, ver. 10.</p>
                  <p>Their good things are ſet downe in this word, <hi>Their Table, Table</hi> ſignifies all creatures prouided for their nouriſhment, meate and drinke.

                  <p>The imprecation of euill things, is of all euil, temporall and ſpirituall, ſet downe in two phraſes:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Let their eyes</hi> (not of bodie but of mind)
<hi>be darkened:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay: Take away their iudgement and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, giue them a reprobate minde, that they may not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne betweene good and euil, that ſo they may runne and fall in finall impenitencie.</p>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14442:182"/>things. Let their minds be vpon their money, as they are the greateſt vſurers in the world. The mindes of ſuch are bowed and crookned to the earth.

                  <p>Thirdly, the cauſe: <hi>Dauid</hi> a holy man curſeth his owne people in this direfull manner, ſurely there muſt be ſome great cauſe. The cauſe is noted <hi>ver.</hi> 9. to be a recompence vnto them. why what did they? <hi>Dauid</hi> foreſaw that they would perſecute Chriſt, ſpeting vpon him, crowning him with thornes: and (hauing beaten him with their fiſts) watching the whole night, making him to carry his croſſe, till he faint vnder it, piercing his hands and feete with nayles, his ſide with a ſpeare, giuing him gall and vinegar to drinke, dealing worſe with him the <hi>ſonne of God</hi> then with theeues. Therefore
<hi>Dauid</hi> wiſheth: Lord as they will ſerue my Lord Chriſt, ſo let them be ſerued. As when Chriſt ſhall come to enlighten them, they will chooſe darkneſſe, ſo let their eyes be darkned: as they will giue him gall and vineger, ſo let their table be their ſnare: as they bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his back, ſo euermore bow downe their backs. This is the law of retalion. Iuſt it is with God that it ſhould be ſo.</p>

                  <p>IN the former part of this Chapter hitherto, <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Reiection of the Iewes is not totall; now hee proues to verſe 33. that ſuch their Reiection is not finall, but that the multitude, (I ſay not, euery Indiuiduall) ſhall be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally called before the end of the world, that Iewes and Gentiles may make one ſheepe-fold and one flocke, vnder one Shepheard Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:14442:184"/>To proue this poynt, diuers arguments are brought by <hi>Paul,</hi> who alone plainely handles this ſecret, in which he inſiſteth the longer, (which is our aduantage alſo in the vnderſtanding of it) for the comfort of the poore Iewes, and for the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the Gentiles, as was touched in the beginning of the Chapter.</p>
                  <p>So haue we in this paſſage two things: firſt, arguments to proue the generall calling of the Iewes before the end of the world: and an admonition to the Gentiles not to inſult, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted at ver. 17. to verſ. 23.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe that a very learned man, makes all the verſes to the 17. to be arguments of admonition to the Gentiles, and that the Apoſtle comes not profeſſedly to the poynt of the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Iewes, till the 23 verſe. In effect it is all one. For if the Gentiles out of that reaſon ought not to inſult, then it muſt be taken for graunted that the Iewes ſhall be called. But this in my opinion is more naturall and plaine.</p>
                  <p>The firſt argument is in this 11 <hi>verſe.</hi> From the end of Gods caſting off the Iewes, which is ſet downe two wayes: firſt, negatiuely: ſecondly, affirmatiuely.</p>
                  <p>The negatiue end is in theſe words. <hi>I ſay then: haue they ſtumbled that they ſhould fall? God forbid.</hi> And it is ſet downe by a Queſtion &amp; an Anſwere to it: the more familiarly to take away all ſcruple out of the minde of the Iewes, who might haue runne mad at the hearing of thoſe direfull curſes out of <hi>Eſay</hi> and <hi>Dauid.</hi> For from thence they might ſay; if wee be thus accurſed by thoſe holy Prophets, then there is no hope left for vs to recouer the fauour of God and be ſaued. O ſayth <hi>Paul</hi> deſpare not. God hath not caſt you off to that end; he hath not made you ſtumble that you ſhould fall and neuer riſe againe (for to <hi>fall</hi> is to be vnderſtood, finally to fall.) This Negation is ſet downe with great earneſtneſſe, as is vſual with
<hi>Paul,</hi> God forbid. God purpoſed no ſuch thing, but he propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome other end to himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is that? <hi>An. viz. That through their fall ſaluation might come to the Gentiles, to prouoke them to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are two ends; one iſſuing out of an other. The 1.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14442:184"/>
                     <hi>That ſaluation might come to the Gentiles,</hi> amplified by mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the occaſion of it: which is <hi>the fall of the Iewes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> God it ſemes reiects the Iewes that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles might be called in: may euill bee done that good may come of it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No. And the reiection of the Iewes is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill but good: an effect of Iuſtice: a puniſhment of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Could not God haue ſaued the Gentiles, if the Iewes had not bene caſt off?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Doubtleſſe he could, but he pleaſed not ſo to doe. The Iewes would not themſelues receiue Chriſt; nor were they content the Gentiles ſhould; being herein like the dog in the manger; it was fit this dog ſhould be driuen away, that the Gentiles might be intromitted and let in at Heauen gates.</p>
                  <p>The end beyond this: <hi>to prouoke them to Ielouſy;</hi> that is, to an earneſt emulation, to recouer the loue of God their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
                  <p>The reiection of the Iewes begets the calling of the Gentiles and this, the emulation of the Iewes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To prouoke them to Ielouſie.</hi> The Greeke word tranſlated to prouoke to Ielouſy, cannot be expreſſed in any one engliſh word which I can call to minde. It was before tranſlated; to prouoked to follow: both which tranſlations, will make vp the ſence, Ielouſy being here taken, for emulation as it is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. <hi>ver.</hi>
14.</p>
                  <p>The roote from whence the word in the text is deriued, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies: either enuy or emulation. Which though they be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time confounded, yet they differ greatly.</p>
                  <p>Enuy is a griefe of minde conceiued at the good of our neighbour, with a deſire and endeuour to diminiſh it, being perſwaded that our excellency is thereby obſcured. Thus <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> and
<hi>Pompey</hi> enuied one another.

                  <p>Emulation is alſo a griefe of minde for the good of our neighbour. But here is the difference: not becauſe that good is in him, but becauſe it is not in vs; not becauſe he is ſo good, <pb n="48" facs="tcp:14442:185"/>but becauſe our ſelues are no better. When a man beholding the graces in his neighbour, and his owne backwardneſſe and wants, is grieued at himſelfe, and prouoked to vſe meanes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſuch graces. This is emulation. And this emulation ſhal the calling of the Gentiles at length breed in the Iewes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhall not be grieued that the Gentiles are ſaued, but that themſelues haue bene ſuch beaſts, and are ſo farre behind the Gentiles, whom they ſhall be ſtirred vp with a holy zeale to ouertake. God dealeth with the Iewes, as a ſchoole-maiſter with ſome one ſcholler, in whom he would faine breed a loue of learning and diligence at his booke; he praiſeth another before his face, and aduanceth him, to ſet his teeth on edge, that ſeeing another praiſed and preferred, he might be prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to plie his booke, to obtaine the like commendation.</p>
                  <p>The argument then you ſee is moſt artificially and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly framed thus: If this be the end of Gods reiecting the Iewes to call the Gentiles, that themſelues might be prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to follow the Gentiles; then the Iewes ſhall be called: but the firſt is true, as in the text: therefore the laſt.

                  <p>God, when the Iewes contemne his fauours, doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to be fauourable to any, but then beſtowes them on the Gentiles.

                  <p>IN this verſe, is the ſecond Argument to proue the calling of the Iewes, taken from the effect of ſuch their calling, namely, the profite and benefite comming thereby to the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If the fall:</hi> The word ſignifies Fault as well as Fall, and ſo reade the Vulgar and the Ancient: expounding Fall infidelity; and then the meaning is: If their infidelitie, much more their faith: there is no difference in the ſenſe, if you ſay Fault; but Fall or Ruine is better, ſo is it the ſame with Diminiſhing: <pb n="51" facs="tcp:14442:186"/>their fall, that is, from their excellent eſtate, their Caſheering as you may ſay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Riches:</hi> Not Temporall, but Spirituall, as the Goſpell, Faith, Repentance, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of the World:</hi> By World is meant all Nations beſide the Iewes: for when the Iewiſh Church ſtood, there could no ſtone be hewed for a Spirituall Temple, but in Iury, nor any pearle found but at Ieruſalem: but now God caſts his bounty ouer all the world, which was before, in compariſon of Iewry, a waſte wilderneſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Diminiſhing:</hi> Not the paucity of beleeuers, meaning the Apoſtles, as though when they ſhall be called, they ſhould be all Preachers with <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> for the conuerſion of the world; for that ſhall not need, in as much as the Iews ſhal not be called till the fulneſſe of the Gentiles be come in: but, their inferiority, their abaſing, they being thruſt, as we may ſay, into the loweſt forme; their leſſening in account with God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of the Gentiles:</hi> the ſame with World as before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Their fulneſſe:</hi> That is, abundance, multitude, (in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of their preſent fewneſſe recei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Argument is thus framed and conceiued, as <hi>Caluine</hi> obſerueth. Whatſoeuer is profitable for the world or Church, God will doe: but the conuerſion of the Iewes Nation will be exceeding profitable.</p>
                  <p>The Propoſition is grounded vpon the exceeding good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God: the Minor is proued in the text, from the leſſe to the greater, thus, If their caſting out be profitable, much more their calling home: for, if that which is euill and workes by accident doe good: then that which is good, will much more, working naturally and by it ſelfe. But the firſt is true, as experience hath proued: therefore the ſecond.</p>

                  <p>A Third Argument is in theſe words, taken from
<hi>Pauls</hi> intention in preaching the Goſpell, as if he ſhould ſay, I doe cheerefully trauell ouer all the world to teach the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; as for other reaſons, ſo alſo for this, becauſe I know the ſtate of the Iews is not deſperate, but that they ſhal be brought home againe.</p>
                  <p>For the attaining of the meaning of theſe two verſes,
<hi>Caluin</hi> hath ſupplied ſome words, which indeed haue inuolued them in more obſcurity. <hi>Beza</hi> reades a great part of the thirteenth verſe in a parentheſis: but His Maieſties Tranſlation vſing no inſertion of words, or parentheſis, is plaineſt and beſt.</p>
                  <p>In theſe words we haue two parts, the Argument and the Confirmation of it.</p>
                  <p>The Argument is in theſe words, <hi>I magnifie mine office, If by any meanes, &amp;c.</hi> The Confirmation in the precedent words of the thirteenth verſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I magnifie mine office:</hi> I make my Apoſtleſhip (that is, his office) honorable and famous, that is, I preach diligently, the effect being put for the cauſe: For that which makes a Preacher famous, is his painfulneſſe and diligence in his office. <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching is not to bee vnderſtood of his preaching to the Iewes, which hee was not bound to doe, as ſome expound; (performing therein a worke of ſupererogation, which might be a ſigne of the conuerſion of the Iewes, or elſe
<hi>Paul</hi> would not preach vnto them.) But, of his preaching to the Gentiles: becauſe the faith of the Gentiles ſhould be by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the occaſion, or a meanes to bring the Iewes forward <pb n="55" facs="tcp:14442:188"/>to Chriſt. The end of <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching is, verſ. 14. which is double: The neerer: <hi>To prouoke them of his fleſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 3.8. 1. Cor. 3.9.</note> that is, the Iewes, <hi>to follow them,</hi> that is, the Gentiles. The remote end,
<hi>that ſome of the Iewes might be ſaued: that I might ſaue ſome of them.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Argument may be thus framed. One end of <hi>Pauls</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent preaching to the Gentiles, is, that the Iewes may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ſaued, therefore they ſhall be conuerted and ſaued.

                     </note> that <hi>Pauls</hi> end in preaching to the Gentiles is the calling of the Iewes, as if he ſhould ſay, In the word of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, or, As I am an Apoſtle to you Gentiles, I doe ſolemnely teſtifie, that the end of my great labours in preaching ouer the world, is not only my obedience to God, and to ſaue you, but to ſaue the Iewes alſo. This Confirmation may bee put into forme thus:</p>
                  <p>The end which <hi>Paul</hi> entends as an Apoſtle, ſhall come to paſſe: But the end before named he auoucheth in the word of an Apoſtle. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo it might be confirmed out of the eleuenth verſe, thus. Gods end cannot faile, but <hi>Pauls</hi> end, is the ſame with Gods end. <hi>Ergo.</hi> If ſuch a calling were not to come, <hi>Pauls</hi> labour in a great part were loſt.</p>

Maintenance, degrees, dignities, make not a Miniſter honorable, but are badges of ſuch: our Church and ſtate, appointing theſe as rewards of them who deſerue to be honoured for their learning and worthineſſe;
<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.17.</note> being a part of that double honour allotted for them by the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>There is a great deale of contempt caſt vpon the miniſtery, and euery baſe fellow can be eloquent enough in diſgracing the Clergie. The way to redeeme our function from the ſcorne of men, is painfulneſſe in our calling, and ſufficiencie of holy gifts for miniſterial emploiments: without theſe, preferments will not do it.

As the honour of a King is in the multitude of his ſubiects, ſo the glory of a Miniſter in the multitude of them he conuerts. As the credit of a ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter is to ſend many to the Vniuerſities, and of a Phyſition to heale many patients, ſo is it the fame of a Miniſter ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to cure many, and to ſend them to heauen.</p>

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 5.</note> There are three ends of a Miniſter in his preaching: firſt, to obey Gods commandement and the Churches who haue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him forth to preach. Secondly, to ſaue the ſoules of his hearers. Thirdly, that their hearers thriuing vnder their labors in faith and godly life, may be a prouocation to others to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them. In aiming at, and attaining theſe three, we glorifie God.</p>
                  <p>Theſe alſo muſt be the ends of hearers in hearing, that they may ſet forth Gods glory: firſt, to obey Gods commandement: ſecondly, to ſaue their ſoules: thirdly, to prouoke others by their example, and ſo to ſaue them.

                  <p>The propoſition of the laſt Syllogiſme is heere auouched by <hi>Paul,</hi> vnder two elegant ſimilitudes. Firſt, from the law of Ceremonies in the firſt part of the verſe. Secondly, from the law of Nature, in the laſt.</p>
                  <p>The Patriarkes are compared to the firſt fruits and roote: the people of the Iewes, to the lump and branches. The Iewes then deſcending from thoſe Patriarkes, to whom and their ſeed for euer the Couenant is made, are ſtill in the Couenant, and therefore their ſtate not deſperate.</p>

Alſo when they had their corne in, and made ready of it for their vſe, they might not eat of it, till they had offered two loaues to the Lord and then was their whole lumpe ſanctified and made lawfull for them to eate.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To teach the Iewes hereby, that they receiued all bleſſings from the Lord. So that as Princes and Nobles, when they beſtow Mannors vpon deſeruing ſeruants, make reſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome fealtie, ſeruice rent, or ſuch like; onely to ſhew that they hold of them. So God required this of the Iewes, that they might know they held in chiefe of him. This law in regard of the Ceremonie is aboliſhed, but the morall part is perpetuall, namely, that we ought to be thankfull to God for his benefits: A thing that the wiſeſt Heathens obſerued, which may the more ſhame many of vs, who day and night partake of Gods good bleſſings, and yet make none or a ſlender ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But to returne to our matter: The ſanctification of
<hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaak</hi> and <hi>Iaacob,</hi> to be the people of God, ſanctifieth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly all their poſterity: As when the two loaues were offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, not only that lumpe or batch of dow, from whence they were taken: but euery kernell was ſanctified to the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them and theirs: ſo the very laſt man, that ſhall bee borne of that Nation, hath right to the Couenant.</p>
                  <p>The ſame is the ſenſe of the other ſimilitude: The branches follow the Nature of the roote, ſo doe the Iewes the ſtate of of thoſe holy Patriarkes in regard of the outward things of the Couenant.</p>

                     </gap>als into this diſcourſe purpoſely; but takes occaſion from the 16
<hi>verſe;</hi> from whence ſome Gentile might or did ſay. We acknowledge the root of the Iewiſh nation to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but what good doth the holineſſe of the root to them: they being reprobated of God forlorne, vagabons, rebells, hauing crucified the Lord of life?</p>
                  <p>Vnto this <hi>Paul</hi> anſweres. <hi>ver.</hi> 17.18. As if he ſhould ſay, I graunt that ſome of the branches be broken off, and thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a wild oliue art graffed into that ſtock and roote: yet (remembring thine owne originall) boaſt not thy ſelfe, diſpiſe not, nor vexe the branches; for if thou beeſt puft vp, thou bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt not the root; but the root thee.</p>
                  <p>Here are two parts: 1. An admonition: 2. the reaſon.</p>
                  <p>The admonition is in theſe words. <hi>Boaſt not thy ſelfe againſt the branches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Boast not thy ſelfe:</hi> the word ſignifieth ſuch a carriage, whereby wee ſhew diſdaine, in ſcornfull lookes, and words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Againſt the branches:</hi> that is the Iewes, whether remaining in the oliue, or broken off.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon is two fold: the 1 <hi>ver.</hi> 17. the other
<hi>ver.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>The firſt reaſon is from a compariſon of the eſtate
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14442:194"/>of the gentiles before their calling with their preſent. Their former eſtate was an eſtate of wrath: their preſent eſtate of mercy. The force of the reaſon is this: thoſe which being in a forlorne eſtate; are of meere grace aduanced, may not boaſt themſelues againſt others. But the gentiles being in ſuch eſtate were of meere grace aduanced:
<hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This eſtate of the Gentiles paſt, and preſent, is ſet downe vnder a moſt elegant ſimilitude.</p>
                  <p>In their firſt eſtate, they are compared, to a wild oliue which is a tree growing in the waſt wilderneſſe, vnfruitfull, with exceeding bitter leaues,
<note place="margin">Ier. 11.16.</note> which the husbandman makes little reckoning of but to hew downe and lay at the fires back. This eſtate is amplified by the Antitheſis of the naturall eſtate of the Iewes, which is compared to a ſweet or garden oliue, fayre, greene, and flouriſhing.</p>
                  <p>Their preſent eſtate is, that they are graffed into the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ſweete oliue, which is the Church of the Iewes: they are not made Iewes,
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.5.</note> but brought into the fellowſhip of that Church by the calling of the goſpell, for graffing in, ſignifies effectuall calling and conuerſion to God.</p>
                  <p>This graffing in, is amplified two wayes: 1 from the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, which is the breaking off of ſome of the branches, that is caſting away ſome of the Iewes for their vnbeleefe: all were not caſt away; for all were not vnbeeleuers: we are graft in among them which remained; or <hi>for them</hi> (as ſome reade) which were cut off.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from the effect of this ingraffing: which is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the iuyce and fatneſſe of the naturall oliue. An O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue is of a iuycie and oylie nature. The grace promiſed in the couenant, is called fatneſſe: becauſe it is as wholeſome to the ſoule, as oyle is to the body. A like phraſe is in the Pſalmes, <hi>My ſoule,</hi> ſaith
<hi>Dauid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 63.6.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhall be ſatisfied with marrow and fatneſſe.</hi> The fauour of God ſhall be to
<hi>Dauid</hi> as marrow and farneſſe to an Epicure. The grace alſo which we receiue from Chriſt (for <hi>of his fulneſſe we receiue</hi>)
<note place="margin">Iohn 1.16.</note> is called <hi>oyle of gladneſſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hebr. 1.9.</note> becauſe it gladdeth the conſcience of ſinners. We partake of this fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by inciſion into the ſtocke, which is the Church of the Iewes. This effect is ſet forth by an adiunct: we partake, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, <pb n="68" facs="tcp:14442:195"/>but with them, that is the Iewes, remaining vnbroken off: ſo that by what grace the Iew is nouriſhed and ſaued, by the ſame grace are we.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme: The Church of the Iewes is the ſtocke or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a ſweete oliue. The roote is <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> with relation to Chriſt, who fils both roote and body with oyle and fatneſſe. Out of this body ſprout many naturall bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: ſome proue vnfruitfull, which the husbandman, which is God, breakes off: and becauſe he hath reſpect to the beautie of his tree, not delighting to ſee it mangled, he goes into the wilderneſſe (the reſt of the world out of the pale of Iewry) and gathereth of the wilde oliue tree (that is the Gentiles) impes which he grafteth in the roome of them which are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and among them which ſtand; whereby theſe wilde impes grow into the naturall oliue, and partake of her fatneſſe with the reſt of the naturall branches.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond reaſon is verſ. 18. taken from the relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the roote and the branches: as if he ſhould ſay: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not a Iew, for he is a branch of that body and root which beares thee: he is a naturall child of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree is deſpiſed (which is vnreaſonable, in as much as he is the roote that beares thee) when his children are deſpiſed.</p>

                     </label> 
                     <hi>The Gentiles may not deſpiſe the Iewes.</hi> They which are aduanced by grace, are not to boaſt againſt them which are in miſery. Pſalme 41.1. Exodus 23.9. Deutreon. 10.19. 1. Corinthians. 13.4.5. The Phariſee diſdained the Publican as a varlet or baſe fellow, with, <hi>This Publican.</hi> But the Publican diſdaines not him, nor is diſdained of God, as the Phariſee was.</p>
                  <p>The vſe of this is either in reſpect of the Iew, or of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect of the Iew:</p>

                  <p>We are graffed in among them, and reciue of the fatneſſe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14442:195"/>with them. The Church of the Iewes, not of Rome, is properly our mother Church. We muſt be the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> if we will haue the promiſes, and therefore beleeuing Gentiles are called the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> not naturall, but by inciſion. We bring nothing to the Iewes, but receiue all from them: for ſaluation is of the Iewes.
<note place="margin">Ioh. 4.22.</note> The Gentiles are not called to make a ſeuerall Church by themſelues, neither do they ſo: for there is but one Church. But they are called to be members of the Church of the Iewes, as Chriſt ſaith:

                  <p>In regard of the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> Thou art made partaker of the fatneſſe. The ſame fatneſſe nouriſheth the naturall and ingraffed branches. The Iew is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by faith in Chriſt, ſo are we.
<note place="margin">Act. 15.11.</note> There is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the way of ſaluation in the old and new Teſtament, but as this: In graffing, there is clay and binding about.

                  <p>Let vs not then boaſt our ſelues againſt the branches: for though they deſerue the contempt that is caſt vpon them, yet woe be to them which are inſtruments to vex them. <hi>Aſſur</hi> the rod of Gods wrath to that people is caſt into the fire;

What we were before this grace receiued wherein we ſtand. 2. <pb n="70" facs="tcp:14442:196"/>How to carry our ſelues in this ſtate of grace. 3. How to know whether we haue receiued true grace, be ingraffed into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall oliue or no.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We were before our ingraffing, wild oliues. Euen as the curſed heath in the wilderneſſe, without Chriſt, without God, ſtrangers from the common wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 17.6.</note> from the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and from the life of God, very caytifes: this <hi>Paul</hi> bids all Gentiles to remember,
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.11.12.</note> that wee may prayſe God for his mercy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hauing receiued grace, carry thy ſelfe without boaſting againſt them that want grace: when thou ſeeſt a profane wretch diſdayne him not, but mourne for him, and ſay, Lord looke mercifully vpon him and turne his heart. Conſidering thy ſelfe, and remembring thy former eſtate haue compaſſion on thy neighbour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thoſe which partake of the fatneſſe of the oliue, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed; this fatneſſe is the grace giuen to the root, which is double: the grace of iuſtification, and ſanctification. If iuſtified and ſanctified: then ingraffed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For iuſtification: oyle is good for medecine, healing wounds, and aſſwaging payne, alſo it makes the countenance cheerefull:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 104.15.</note> ſo the grace of our Lord Ieſus, which is called the oyle of gladneſſe, maketh the righteous merry and ioyfull. Feeleſt thou the mercy of God in the pardon of thy ſinnes, and haſt peace with God? This is the fatneſſe of the oliue; thou art ingraffed, and become the child of Abraham, the child of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sanctification may be knowne by effects and properties of it. The effects are three. 1. In the heart. 2. In the tongue. 3. In the life.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. If thu beeſt ingraffed thou wilt bring forth much fruit: for the oliue is exceeding fruitfull. The fruite of the oliue is both for God and man. 1. For God. Oyle was conſecrate to the Lord, was vſed in ſacrifice, and for the holy lamps, for it is a nouriſher of light; ſo thou wilt be religious, a keeper of the ſabboth, a worſhipper of God, a fauourer of the Goſpell. 2. For man. It is both for medicine and meate. Kings, Preiſts and Prophets were annoynted with it. Our liues muſt be fruitfull and profitable to the Church; we muſt not be for nothing, or onely to ſpend ſtouer, as they ſay. Let ours, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> learne to ſhew forth good workes, for neceſſary vſes, that they bee not vnfruitfull.
<note place="margin">Tit. 3.14.</note> If we liue without doing good we are no oliue branches. Our obedience muſt be to God and man: to the firſt and ſecond table of the law.</p>
                  <p>The properties of our obedience, are foure, according to ſuch properties of the oliue. That is. 1. Speedie. 2. Peaceable. 3. continuall. 4, chearefull.

                  <p n="2">2. Our fruit muſt be peaceable. An oliue branch was a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of peace, as a palme of victory. <hi>Iames</hi> ſayth that the fruit of righteouſneſſe is ſowne in peace:
<note place="margin">Iam. 3.17.</note> pride, diſdaine; quarreling <pb n="72" facs="tcp:14442:197"/>and contending with our neighbours, is a note of a bramble, not of an Oliue branch. If you powre out water, it maketh a noiſe, daſheth, and beſprinkleth you. But the powring out of oyle, is without noiſe falling downe ſoftly and with great ſilence. So the ſeruants of God muſt be peaceable.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Our obedience muſt be continuall, once and alwayes to beare fruit. The Oliue alwaies flouriſheth, is alwaies greene, and neuer caſtes the leaues: noting the conſtant tenour wee ſhould keepe in our obedience: <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 92.14.</note> That they which bee planted in Gods houſe, ſtill bring foorth fruit, and flouriſh in their age. If thy obedience bee not continuall, it is not ſound.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Our obedience muſt be cheerful, thy loue to thy neighbor muſt be free. Anointing with oyle, makes vs lithe and nimble, ſo if we haue receiued hereof, we wil not come to the Church as though we were ſtiffe in the ioynts, like a beare to the ſtake, but with <hi>Dauid</hi> we will runne in the wayes of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements: The Oliue requires no great coſt to make it fruitful: nor a man truely ſanctified, great intreatie to perſwade him to doe good.

                  <p>The Gentile taking in ſome ſcorne, that <hi>Paul</hi> in the 17. v. had auouched the Iew to be the naturall Oliue, and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile a wilde Oliue, obiecteth, as if he had ſaid, Tell not mee, <hi>Paul,</hi> of theſe things: let the Iew bee what he will, I am as I am; yet (by your leaue) he is broken off, that I might be graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed <pb n="73" facs="tcp:14442:197"/>in, which ſhewes that God ſaw more worthineſſe in mee, then in the Iew: The merchant parteth not with his preſent fraught, but for better lading: neither will any man ſuffer an inciſion or ſcarifying in his armes or feet, but for preſeruation of a more noble member, as the eye or head.</p>
                  <p>His Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t may be framed in an <hi>Enthymeme,</hi> thus, They are broken off, that I might be grafted in; Therefore I may boaſt.</p>
                  <p>To this <hi>Paul</hi> anſweres, verſ. 20. which his anſwere is either to the Antecedent: <hi>Well, becauſe of vnbeleefe they are broken off, thou ſtandeſt by faith:</hi> or to the conſequence,
<hi>Be not high min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but feare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His anſwere to the Antecedent hath two parts: 1. A Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, <hi>Well:</hi> 2. A correction, in the reſt of the words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Well:</hi> Some take this word ironically and by way of incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, as we much vſe it in our Engliſh tongue, ſaying,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſel.</hi>
                     </note> well, well, when we meane that it is not well. But heere it is taken for a Conceſſion,
<hi>Paul</hi> grants the thing: <hi>viz.</hi> That the Iewes are broken off, that the Gentiles might come in: But he addes a <hi>prouiſo,</hi> alwaies remembred, that the proper cauſe of the breaking off of the Iew was his infidelitie, not the comming in of the Gentile: For this came to paſſe by a ſecond &amp; accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal conſideration: and the proper cauſe of the comming in and ſtanding of the Gentiles, is faith, that is, the grace of God. The Gentile then vnderſtood not himſelfe, being like a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſeruant that runnes away without his errand: for if he had taken all with him, he would haue diſcerned cauſe of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not of boaſting herein.</p>
                  <p>The Gentiles Argument is a meere paralogiſme, alledging that which is not the cauſe, for that which is. The vnbeleefe of the Iew, being the cauſe of their breaking off, not the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in of the Gentiles. So that
<hi>Paul</hi> anſweres, as if he ſhould ſay, Learne (thou Gentile) to diſtinguiſh betweene the cauſe and the euent. It fell out, that the Iew being caſt out, thou wert receiued in: but this was not the cauſe of that, neither is thy goodneſſe the cauſe of thy ſtanding in the Oliue, which wert wont to ſtand among the bryers in the wilderneſſe. God could haue brought thee in, without breaking off the Iewes, <pb n="74" facs="tcp:14442:198"/>but he would not; but hath done thee good out of their euill, and hath brought thee in, that thou mighteſt be the cauſe of their bringing in againe.</p>
                  <p>The proper cauſe of the breaking off of the Iew, his infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: of the ſtanding of the Gentile, Gods grace.</p>
                  <p>Faith is the gift of God, whereby we know, apprehend and apply the promiſes, relying vpon them. Infidelity is a fruit of corruption, whereby we know not the promiſes, or knowing, beleeue them not, or beleeuing them to be true, make them not our confidence.</p>
                  <p>Standing notes an eſtate wherein a man hath the fauour of God to iuſtification and ſaluation: Breaking off, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                  <p>Standing is a manifeſtation of Election, by faith, heere: by ſaluation, hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Breaking off, is a manifeſtation of Gods Iudgement: in this world, by taking away from a people, the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, the tokens of his loue, and cogniſance of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo are the Iewes, and alſo thoſe famous Churches of Aſia, broken off: and by giuing particular perſons to hardneſſe of heart. After this world, by ſeparating ſuch from Angels and Saints, and by throwing them into hell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect. It ſeemes then that a man may bee a branch and yet broken off?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Similitudes are not to be preſſed too farre: Branches are to be diſtinguiſhed: ſome that haue onely an outward fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Oliue, theſe may be broken off: ſome that haue an inward, partaking of the ſappe and fatneſſe of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, theſe cannot. So that there are Infidels out of the Church and Infidels in the Church. The firſt Infidelitie is called Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue, the ſecond, Priuatiue.</p>
                  <p>Yet it is to bee vnderſtood that faith is not ſo the cauſe of ſtanding, as infidelity is of breaking off: for infidelity is the meritorious cauſe of breaking off, and faith but the inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or ſtaffe whereby we ſtand.</p>

                  <p>This conſideration ſhould moue vs to three things: Firſt, <pb n="76" facs="tcp:14442:199"/>to ſeeke faith: Secondly, to examine whether wee beleeue or no: Thirdly, to mourne for infidelity.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. By the meanes whereby it is wrought, which is the preaching of the Goſpell. If it ariſe from a conceite of thine owne braine: it is but a mocke-faith, and will not ſtead thee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the manner how it is wrought: firſt, there is in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true beleeuer, a ſight of ſinne: Secondly, Humiliation for it: Thirdly, a change of the heart: Fourthly, a hungring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter righteouſneſſe, then comes faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By the fruits: faith workes by loue: As the fruit ſhewes the tree, ſo obedience ſhewes faith. Many ſhew plainely they haue no faith, for when proſperitie comes they feare not God, and when aduerſitie, they runne from God to the Creature, to Wizards, to the Diuell for helpe, as if there were no God in Iſrael. Herein they are like a dogge; hold vp a cruſt he comes fawning; hold vp a cudgell, and he runnes away: ſo many, let them thriue, then God is a good God. But let God lay his hand vpon them; then they are gone to ſeeke a new maſter, the Diuell: yea if it bee but for the ſauing a pigge or a cow, what are ſuch but Infidels?</p>
                  <p>Faith purifyeth the heart; it will not ſuffer a man to be an Hypocrite: to bee one thing without, and another within: one thing before men, and another in ſecret: Hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues Chriſt died and ſhed his bloud for him, cannot but die to ſinne, and delight to liue righteouſly.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Mourne for infidelitie: euen for the leaſt motion to it: <pb n="77" facs="tcp:14442:199"/>and the rather becauſe it is the faſhion of moſt, to mourne for other things, and not for this. If a man be robd, or his houſe be burnt; he cryes out I am vndone. But who is heard to cry, woe is me for want of faith, I am vndone for my vnbeleefe? If wee heare of a theefe, we cry, hang him, and perhaps we will cry ſhame on a drunkard; but there are few cry ſhame of themſelues for infidelity, that maine mother ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Infidelitie is the bar of all goodneſſe: if a man heare the word without fayth it profits him not:

If thou wouldſt haue comfort of thy guifts be humble.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Impatience of admonition; to be deafe on that eare is a plaine token of pride.
<note place="margin">Ioh. 9.39.40.</note> The phariſes who were proud, take it in great ſcorne, that Chriſt reproueth them of blindneſſe, when indeed they were beetle blind. Proud <hi>Zidkiah</hi> cannot endure <hi>Micaiah</hi> his admonition.
<note place="margin">2. chron. 18.23</note> He that ſwelleth when he is told of his fault, hath a proud heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Diſgracing and diminiſhing the guifts of others with boaſting of our owne, declares a high mind. The proud phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee abaſed the publican and exalted himſelfe, Doeſt thou im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14442:200"/>vnto others that they are cold, couetous &amp;c. ſaying, thou wouldeſt be aſhamed if thou wert no better then they, neuer looking at thine owne infidelity, pride, hypocriſie, &amp;c. Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou haſt a proud heart.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Medling with things aboue our vnderſtanding or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, notes pride alſo: many preſently vpon their ſuppoſed conuerſion, enter into controuerſies, cenſure particular men, yea whole Churches, as if they were ignorant of nothing, when indeed they know nothing, as they ought to know: they ruſh into matters beyond the age of their Chriſtianity. <hi>Dauid</hi> approued his humility,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 131.</note> by not medling with things which were too high for him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Contention alſo argues pride, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith:
<note place="margin">Prou. 13.10.</note> What is the cauſe that in our Church many put quarrels, and vrge with much violence their owne conceits, as if they were vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Articles of the Faith? Surely it is our pride that makes our good <hi>Rebecca</hi> complaine of our ſtriuing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond part of this vſe is for remedie, where wee haue three things: Firſt the place to which the remedy is to be applied: Secondly, the remedy it ſelfe: Thirdly the perſons that need it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The place is the heart as <hi>Peter</hi> aduiſeth,
<hi>Decke your ſelues inwardly with lowlineſſe of minde.</hi> There may be an abatement of pride outwardly, and yet neuertheleſſe within: according to our ſaying: There may bee as much pride vnder a leather Iacket as vnder a veluet gowne: who ſeemed more humble then <hi>Diogenes</hi> in his tubbe? and yet there was ſcarce any thing more proud, as wiſe <hi>Plato</hi> could obſerue. A man would think that nothing could be more lowly and meeke then a Monke or Frier, in his Cell, and vnder his Cowle, but the leſſe p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ide is in their habite, the more is in their heart: Their Maſters Title is a very lowly one, <hi>Seruus ſeruorum;</hi> but if a man ſhould ſay that he were proud, hee need neuer to come vnder confeſſion for it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The remedy conſiſts of many particulars (wee cannot haue too much againſt this foule euil) which vſed with praier will be of force to keepe our hearts from ſwelling.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt thing I commend to be vſed: is a continuall <pb n="80" facs="tcp:14442:201"/>remembrance of theſe and the like Scriptures:
<hi>Be not high min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: God reſiſts the proud,</hi> &amp;c. Draw forth theſe as a ſword to take downe this Peacocke.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Remember the example and monition of Chriſt:
<hi>Learne of me,</hi> (not to walke vpon the ſea, or to make a world) but to be <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>lowly in ſpirit:</hi> Is Chriſt humble, then be thou aſhamed to be proud?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider how God hath iudged the proud. Pride thruſt Angels out of heauen; our firſt Parents out of Paradiſe; han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vp <hi>Haman</hi> vpon his owne gallowes, made <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> a beaſt, &amp;c. Take heed by theſe examples.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider, that if thou haſt any excellencie, it is the gift of God:
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.6.7.</note> 
                     <hi>What haſt thou which thou haſt not receiued?</hi> It is an Aſſe that will be proud of a Lions skin, which is not his owne. And God can take away thy knowledge, and make thee an Ideot, or ſtrike thee with madneſſe; and if thou beeſt rich, in the turning of an hand, hee can make thee as poore as
<hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Doth thy heart tickle thee, becauſe of thy knowledge, faith, patience, &amp;c? Sit downe and caſt thy account, thou ſhalt finde vpon thy reckoning that thy wants are more then thy receipts: for one thing thou knoweſt thou art ignorant of ten: If thou haſt one good thought, thou haſt a thouſand ill ones, which ariſe out of thy heart, as the ſmoke out of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pit. As <hi>Goliah</hi> is bigger then
<hi>Dauid,</hi> ſo for the terme of this life, corruption is more then grace. Looke vpon thy dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in prayer, thy wandering thoughts, thy hypocriſie, &amp;c. Hold thy ſelfe to this taske, and thou ſhalt finde more cauſe of mourning then of Pride. As ballaſt is to the ſhip, ſo will this meditation be to thee, that thou ſhalt not be turned about with the waues of ſelfe-conceit. <hi>Pliny</hi> records a ſecret of the Bee,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Plin. Nat. hiſt. lib.</hi> 11.
<hi>cap.</hi> 10.</note> that in a ſtorme, it getteth vp a little ſtone, by the weight of it to flye the more ſteadily, and to get home in ſafety. If thou bee in danger to be blowne away with pride, let the thoughts of thy wants be to thee as this little ſtone.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The parties that ſtand in need of theſe remedies, are all men, ſpecially thoſe which are extraordinarily graced by God, euen ſuch as are truely ſanctified: all other ſinnes are in euill,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14442:201"/>this is in that which is good, and therefore the harder to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided.

Study and pray for Humility, the honor of a Chriſtian. It is the firſt, ſecond and third thing to bee ſought for of a Chriſtian, as pronuntiation is of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> his Orator. <hi>Moſes</hi> face ſhone when he had talked with God,
<note place="margin">Exod. 34.19.</note> and he wiſt not. And excellent degree of grace is it, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and not to take notice of it. As boughes the more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with fruit, are the more lowly, and as when the Sunne is at the higheſt, our ſhadowes are at the ſhorteſt; ſo the more grace would be adorned with the more humility.</p>
                  <p>The Diuell will tempt thee to all vitiouſneſſe; if he cannot preuaile that way, he will tempt thee to be proud of thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; yea to be proud, becauſe thou art not proud. In the middeſt of grace, pray for an humble heart.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. For diſpaire. Sinners diſpayre, becauſe they cannot be perſwaded of mercie, only veiwing the ſeueritie of God, and poring vpon that: haſt thou offended God and therefore art afflicted in conſcience? Alaſſe thou haſt deſerued to be a fire-brand of hell; but yet conſider the ſweete goodneſſe of God: he is iuſt to damne ſtubborne ſinners that repent not: but to ſuch as humble themſelues, and with penitent hearts beg for mercie, he is a ſweete God.

Only beleeue it, and repent.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For preſumption. As the act of ſeeing, is hindered both by no light and by too much: ſo the light and comfort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience <pb n="87" facs="tcp:14442:204"/>is hindered, either by no ſeeing of mercie, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth deſpaire; or by ſeeing nothing elſe but mercie, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth preſumption. Satan will tell thee, thou maiſt take thy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, follow thy pleaſures, needeſt not be ſo preciſe, for God is mercifull. Thy remedy is to conſider not onely the mercie, but the ſeueritie of God alſo. He is as iuſt as mercifull. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how ſeuerely he hath dealt with the Iewes; they haue bene almoſt this 1600. yeares vagabonds for their rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt and his Goſpell. Forget not his ſeueritie to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> for the matter of <hi>Vriah:</hi> how he not onely viſited <hi>Dauids</hi> conſcience, but tooke him vp, and made him an example to all the world, plaguing him in his <hi>Amnon, Abſolon, Adoniah.</hi> Thinke of <hi>Moſes</hi> that meeke man, whom God calls his friend, yet for one fault, (and that ſo ſecret, as by reading the ſtorie we can ſcarce finde it out) for ſtriking the rocke, when he ſhould onely haue onely ſpoken to it in confidence, was bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red entrance into the land of Canaan.

If therefore the diuell tell thee that God is mercifull: tel him againe, that he is moſt iuſt and ſeuere alſo. The rather conſider ſeriouſly hereof, becauſe a thouſand periſh this way, to one that periſheth by deſperation. Deſperation is a courſe that Satan takes but with a few, becauſe it is tedious to fleſh and bloud, and often proues the occaſion of a mans conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſo the diuell is ouerſhot in his owne bowe. But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is pleaſing. To liue as we liſt, to enioy our pleaſures, and then go to heauen when we haue done, what can be more pleaſing to fleſh and bloud?

                  <p>Thus theſe words, pertaine to the former exhortation, and with all the Apoſtle in them falls into his former argument to proue the reiection of the Iewes not to be finall: and ſo we will conſider of this verſe, <hi>viz.</hi> as it belongs to thoſe things which follow.</p>
                  <p>In this verſe and thoſe which follow, the Apoſtle ſheweth three things concerning the generall calling of the Iewes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of the world.

In this verſe we haue two things: firſt a propoſition, <hi>The Iew if he continue not in his vnbeleefe, ſhall be graffed in.</hi> Secondly, a reaſon from the power of God, <hi>For God is able to graffe him in againe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle here ſpeaketh of the multitude of the Iewes, of whoſe calling the Gentiles deſpaired, as of a thing impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but
<hi>Paul</hi> tels them it is poſſible, by the almightie power of God.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. Paul</hi> proues not here directly it ſhall be ſo, but that it is poſſible, which is enough againſt the Gentiles, in this, that they held it to be impoſſible. But if we be certaine of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14442:206"/>will of God, then from his power is a certaine Argument. Now a <hi>Quere</hi> may be heere made, whether that there bee not alway in things of this nature, a ſecret ſuppoſall of the will of God, as where

                  <p>IN this verſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewes that the calling of the Iewes is probable: The Argument is a <hi>fortiore,</hi> from the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the leſſe likely to the more likely.</p>
                  <p>This is not to bee referred to the laſt clauſe of the former verſe, but to the firſt, that the Iewes ſhall be graft in, if they continue not in vnbeleefe. This is probable: why? becauſe he hath graffed in the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles, which is leſſe likely to be done, therefore it is probable, that he wil reingraffe the Iewes, which is more likely.</p>
                  <p>He proues that it is more likely for the Iewes, then it was for vs, from the naturall condition of both.</p>
                  <p>We are branches of the wilde Oliue, they of the right O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue: it is contrary to nature, to graffe a wilde Oliue branch into a right Oliue: but naturall to graffe into it a naturall branch. A man cuts off the boughes of a tree in his Orchard, <pb n="94" facs="tcp:14442:208"/>purpoſing to graffe it: he goes not to the field to gather Imps of a crabbe: but rather if he haue no choiſe, hee will take an Impe of the owne, which is more likely to beare good fruit.

                  <p>IN theſe words the Apoſtle proues the certaintie of the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Iewes, and he takes his argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from a revelation of this ſecret vnto him by the Spirit of God, to be made knowne to the Gentiles; ſo that this Scripture is a propheſie, and is of the nature of a demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>Here, and ſo to the 33. verſe, are three things: firſt, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face: ſecondly, the propheſie: thirdly, the proofe.</p>
                  <p>The preface is in theſe words, <hi>I would not brethren that you ſhould be ignorant of this myſterie, leſt you ſhould be wiſe in your owne conceits.</hi> Where are two things: firſt, the nature of this propheſie: ſecondly, an admonition concerning it. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it is ſet downe in this word <hi>myſterie.</hi> Myſteries are of two ſorts: firſt, when ſome ſpirituall thing is ſhadowed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der viſible ſignes, ſo the Sacraments are called myſteries, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly: ſecondly, when ſome ſacred thing is reuealed by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall illumination, or by the euent, which could neuer be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by ſtudie, but by the Spirit of God: ſo the doctrine of the Trinitie of perſons in the vnitie of the Godhead; the perſonall vnion of the two natures in Chriſt, the myſticall v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Chriſt and his Church, the reſurrection of the dead, the calling of the Gentiles, the recalling of the Iewes, of which we ſpeake. This is a great ſecret, and in <hi>Pauls</hi> time more ſecret to the Gentile then to the Iew, for theſe had a glimmering of a deliuerance to come; but how, what, and when, they knew not.</p>
                  <p>In the admonition are three things: firſt the perſons admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, which are the Gentiles, whom <hi>Paul</hi> a Iew calleth
<hi>bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> The profeſſion of the Goſpell makes all profeſſors bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. <pb n="97" facs="tcp:14442:210"/>Therefore we ſhould all liue in vnitie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the admonition, which is, that the <hi>Gentiles ſhould not be ignorant of this ſecret.</hi> How well doe they follow
<hi>Paul,</hi> who contradict this as falſe. Againe, this myſterie is neceſſary to be knowne, much more other myſteries.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the vſe of the knowledge of this ſecret, that the Gentiles ſhould not be arrogant in themſelues, that their pride in which they contemned the Iewes, might be curbed. <hi>Paul</hi> touched them for this before, v. 18.20. here alſo he meets with them for it: ſo profitable is it for vs, often to be admoniſhed of that vice to which we are moſt inclined.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond generall thing, is the propheſie it ſelfe, in theſe words, <hi>Blindneſſe is partly come to Iſrael vntill the fulneſſe of the Gentiles be come in, and ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaued.</hi> Here are two things: firſt, a deſcription of the preſent eſtate of the Iewes, <hi>Blindneſſe in part is happened to Iſrael.</hi> Secondly, a reuealing of ſome ſecret things concerning this eſtate: which are two: firſt, how long this blindneſſe is to endure; namely <hi>till the fulneſſe of the Gentiles be come in.</hi> This is one ſecret. Secondly, what ſhal become of them when this fulneſſe is come in; then
<hi>all Iſrael ſhall be ſaued,</hi> ver. 26.</p>
                  <p>In the deſcription of their preſent eſtate, are foure things: firſt, the perſons, <hi>Iſrael:</hi> ſecondly, the thing,
<hi>blindneſſe:</hi> thirdly the manner, <hi>is hapned:</hi> fourthly the degree, <hi>in part</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The perſons, <hi>Iſrael:</hi> this terme is three wayes taken: firſt for a name of <hi>Iacob</hi> the Patriarke; not ſo here: ſecondly figuratiuely for all the elect; nor ſo here, becauſe of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition betweene Iſrael and Gentile: thirdly for the people of the Iewes which are the carnall ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and
<hi>Iacob;</hi> ſo it is here to be taken, which is confirmed from the thing it ſelfe, which ſpeaketh as much, namely the preſent blindneſſe of that people,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The thing, <hi>blindneſſe of mind,</hi> which is the cauſe of their reiection, the cauſe put for the effect.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The maner <hi>is hapned,</hi> not at aduenture, but is caſt vpon them by the iuſt iudgement of God: a iudiciall hardneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide thir naturall.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The degree, <hi>in part:</hi> this word either notes the time, or <pb n="98" facs="tcp:14442:210"/>is added to the thing or to the perſons.
<hi>Ambroſe</hi> referres it to the time, which (and may be very well) is receiued of many. <hi>Caluin</hi> referres it to the thing, as if <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould ſay, mitigating the matter: They are become blind after a ſort or in ſome part. But this I take it cannot be: firſt becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> hath before ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauated their hardneſſe, and here to vnſay it, agrees not with the Spirit by which <hi>Paul</hi> wrote: ſecondly, all experience ſhews that the Iewes are not after a ſort in a ſmall meaſure, but in a wonderfull high degree hardned, ſtill railing at and bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Chriſt and his Goſpell; neither is their puniſhment light, which for ſuch blindneſſe is inflicted. The beſt, in my opinion is to attribute it to the perſons: <hi>In part,</hi> that is, not all, not to euery indiuiduall amongſt them, but to ſome: and ſo it agrees with the ſence of the firſt part of the Chapter, that the reiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Iews is not totall: alſo with that 17. verſe, <hi>Some of the branches are broken off:</hi> and with ver. 26. <hi>And ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaued.</hi> Iſrael in part, and <hi>all Iſrael,</hi> ſeeme to be termes aptly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing themſelues.</p>
                  <p>The two ſecrets follow: the firſt, how long this blindneſſe ſhall contiue, viz. <hi>Till the fulneſſe of the Gentiles be come in.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vntill:</hi> not, that the fulneſſe of the Gentiles might come in, as ſome: for firſt, it agreeth not with the words: ſecondly, it was no ſecret to the Gentile, neither were they ignorant that the Iewes were caſt off that they might enter: thirdly, the word is to be taken in his proper ſence, in as much as it agrees with the place, and with other Scriptures.</p>

                  <p>Some oppoſe this, auerring that <hi>Iſrael</hi> is here taken for the elect of the Iewes and Gentiles. I confeſſe that
<hi>Iſrael</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſo taken, but here it cannot: and they which affirme it, bring no ſhadow of reaſon for their ſaying, but their bare word. But many things make it plaine, that by <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt be vnderſtood onely the nation of the Iewes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is to be taken here, as it is before throughout this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; but it is to be taken for the nation, ver. 1, 2, 3. Againſt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. The perpetuall oppoſition ſo often iterated from v. 11. to the 33. euince, that here alſo it is to be taken oppoſitiuely to the Gentile, and ſo of the Iew.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Many things in the text plainly ſhew it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that he would not haue the Gentiles igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: <pb n="101" facs="tcp:14442:211"/>of what? that all the elect ſhould be ſaued. Who euer doubted of it? but of the calling of the Iewes, there was a doubt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he calls it a ſecret or myſterie: but that all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſhould be ſaued, is no ſecret.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that you ſhould not be wiſe in your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits. But if he here had onely declared that the fulneſſe of the Gentiles ſhould come in, and that all the elect amongſt them ſhould be ſaued, this would haue made them more conceited: but <hi>Pauls</hi> drift is here to commend the Iewes, not the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and ſo, the coherence bindeth, that
<hi>Iſrael</hi> is to be vnderſtood as before ver. 25.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>Iſrael</hi> is called <hi>Iacob,</hi> ver. 26. which terme I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not, ſo much as once to be (certainly) taken for the elect of Iew and Gentile.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, the prophecies v. 26, 27. are neceſſarily to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the Iewes, as the oppoſition continued in the verſes following plainly ſheweth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> But there is no mention of this terme
<hi>Iewes</hi> in this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Iewes are called Iſraelites, as by the more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, generall, and honorable name, and alſo becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies in the 9, 10, and this Chapter runnes in this terme
<hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> And by <hi>Iſrael</hi> there is nothing more euident then that the Iewes are vnderſtood as Math. 10.5. ſo alſo c. 9. v. 24. there is mention made of Iewes, who ver. 27. are called <hi>Iſrael.</hi> So in this Chapter, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that he is an Iſraelite: and in another place he ſaith he is a Iew: ſo Act. 2.14. and 22. Iewes and Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites are taken for the ſame people.</p>
                  <p>Therefore there is no colour that any man ſhould auouch
<hi>all Iſrael,</hi> to be taken otherwiſe then for the nation of the Iewes.</p>

<hi>Beza</hi> ſaith, It is very often deliuered in the Prophets.
<hi>Origen</hi> proues it out of Hoſ. 2.7. <hi>Aquinas</hi> out of Hoſ.

                  <p>To theſe I thinke may be added two pregnant places of the new Teſtament, as Luk. 2.32. where Chriſt is called <hi>the glorie of his people Iſrael,</hi> which muſt be vnderſtood of their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He is not the glorie onely of a few, but of the people and multitude. But as yet
<hi>Simeons</hi> prophecie hath not taken effect, for the people haue not glorified Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Alſo Act. 1.6,7. the Apoſtles expected the reſtoring of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael: they aske our Sauiour of the time; who anſwers, that it is not for them to know the times which the Father hath put in his owne hand. In which anſwer, Chriſt denies not that there ſhould be ſuch a time, but, as to me appeares, ſecretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth it.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, they wonderfully increaſe in all places where they are ſuffered, as writers and trauellers report. Wherein is yet fulfilled that part of the promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that his ſeed ſhould be as the ſtars in heauen. If this promiſe be yet of force to them, why not the principall promiſe, that God ſhould be their God?</p>
                  <p>Farther, the prouidence of God wonderfully appeares in preſeruing them to be yet a diſtinct people, knowne in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from other nations, continuing a nation, though they be hated and oppreſſed in all kingdomes, and kept vnder by moſt ſeuere lawes. It is not for nothing that God thus preſerues them, whereas in much ſhorter time many other nations are quite extirpated.</p>

It is the opinion of <hi>Lyra,</hi> in his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie vpon this Chapter, and ſo generally of the Papiſts, that the Iewes ſhall be called preſently vpon the diſcouery of the falſitie of Antichriſt: which (if you vnderſtand of a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious diſcouery then yet hath bene) may haue ſome correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with the truth: alwayes prouided, that you ſeek not for Antichriſt at Rome, leſt you find him with a triple crowne <pb n="103" facs="tcp:14442:212"/>on his head: And therefore the Ieſuite direct vs to ſeeke for Antichriſt among the Iewes, in the Tribe of <hi>Dau,</hi> at Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem: wherein they are like ſuch birds, who commonly draw vs away from their neaſts, by their fluttering and noiſe, for the ſafety of their yong: For their fable of Antichriſt, and of

The comparing of theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Obſtinacy and Saluation, ſhew that an obſtinate man, <hi>quà talis,</hi> is not in the ſtate of grace and ſaluation. Who haue this obſtinate heart? Surely the Iewes, as we ſee, but we need not ſeeke a Iew to find it; among our ſelues is this iudgement fallen. Concerning which, we will at this time note theſe foure things: Firſt, the miſery of an obſtinate heart: Secondly, the meanes whereby wee come into ſuch an eſtate: Thirdly, the effects of it: Fourthly the ſignes of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Iobs</hi> eſtate was miſerable when he vnderwent all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie the Diuell could deuiſe; yet all that is nothing to a blinde obſtinate heart, this is worſe, only hell worſe then it. There are two eſtates of the heart moſt fearefull: to feele ſinne too much; and to be paſt feeling. In the firſt were <hi>Cham</hi> and
<hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> whoſe ends were deſperate: But the ſecond eſtate is more fearefull, pray againſt it: if you ſay a damnable, diuelliſh, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh heart, of any heart, it is true of the obſtinate heart. The ſoft repenting heart, is a heauenly heart: there is a naturall hardneſſe which is in all, but the Iudiciall is a forerunner of damnation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A man comes not to the height of this obſtinacie at the firſt, but it is ſome time a working by certaine meanes: The meanes cooperating with the Diuell in our hardning are two: Firſt, Cuſtome in ſinning: euen as a path is hardned by the continuall trampling of the paſſengers, ſo by cuſtome in euil, is the conſcience by little and little cruſhed and made inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. At the firſt there is ſhame and trembling; but being ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in euill, men ſcorne reproofes, as the Leuiathan laugheth at the ſhaking of the ſpeare. Stories record of one who, through cuſtome, made poyſon ſo familiar to him, that hee dranke it without danger;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mithridates,</hi>
                     </note> ſo wicked men by cuſtome, make blaſphemies, whoredomes, drunkenneſſe, and all prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſo familiar, that their ſtomackes are neuer offended with <pb n="106" facs="tcp:14442:214"/>them. The ſecond meanes, is neglect of the meanes of grace offered. This ſhut vp the Iewes in obſtinacy; and ordinarily for this is this iudgment of God inflicted vpon men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The effects of this hardneſſe are two.
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.1.2.3.</note> 1. A departing from the faith, broaching the doctrines of diuels, denying manifeſt truth, and holding and ſeeming any thing to obtaine our owne ends.
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.18.</note> As when men will be Papiſts, Proteſtants, neuters, any thing, nothing, as they ſee it beſt ſerue their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick plots.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Committing vncleanneſſe, and other abominable ſins with greedineſſe, delighting in nothing but in beſotting vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This hardneſſe is two wayes diſcerned. 1. When no Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2. When no mercy can moue to remorſe. When the word, which is a hammer, a ſword, and water can neither by the thundring of iudgment, bruiſe, or make any dint into our hearts, nor by the pleaſing ſound of mercy, mollify vs and make vs relent; there is hardneſſe vnſpeakeable. The diuill trembles at iudgment: the hard heart trembleth not. He that can read the bitter paſſion of our bleſſed Sauiour for vs wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and can conſider, how by his pretious bleeding heart hee intreateth vs to be reconciled, offring vs mercy; and relents not muſt needs haue a heart as hard as the nether milſtone.</p>

                  <p>The argument is brought in by a prolepſis. What, the Iewes (might ſome ſay) pardoned and called? Gods enemie? whom God hates? Yes, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> euen the Iewes: for though in ſome reſpect they are

                  <p>THe Iewes ſhall be pardoned their obſtinacie, verſe
26.27. becauſe they are beloued of God, verſe 28. and they are
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:14442:217"/>beloued, becauſe of Election, and for their Fathers ſake, verſ. 28. for the Nature of Gods loue is vnchangeable: once loued, and euer loued.</p>
                  <p>Some of the Gentiles might ſay, what if their Fathers were beloued? what is that to ſtubborne and obſtinate children, that walke not in their fathers waies? Vnto this <hi>Paul</hi> anſweres, that whatſoeuer they are; yet the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The gifts,</hi> that is, of Gods ſpeciall loue, not ordinary or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts, but choyce ones, which come of ſpeciall grace, and make vs gracious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And calling,</hi> that is, to ſauing knowledge, to obedience, and that both outward and inward.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The gifts and calling:</hi> not the gifts of calling, but diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, concluding election and calling with all the effects of both.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The gifts and calling:</hi> that is thoſe gifts, and that calling are without repentance, for ſome gifts are with repentance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Without repentance.</hi> Vſually Repentance is taken for that grace whereby our hearts are changed, and wee turne from our ſinnes to God: but not ſo heere. It is not ſpoken heere as a thing in vs, but in God for our vnderſtanding: the fained cauſe, being put for the true effect. It is ſpoken after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men, but muſt bee vnderſtood after the manner of God.</p>
                  <p>Repentance is not properly in God: It is attributed to him
<hi>ſecundum modum,</hi> according to the manner, but not <hi>ſecundum rem,</hi> according to the thing. When God ſeemes to doe that which men doe indeed: then that which is the cauſe of ſuch doing in men, is attributed to God, and ſo on the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Men vſe to reuenge when they are angry: Therefore when God auengeth himſelfe vpon ſinners, Anger is attributed to him; not indeed, but by ſimilitude, for that which in men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proceeds of Anger, in God comes from his moſt quiet iuſtice: ſo when men change that which they haue done, they are ſaid to repent, and when they change not, they are ſaid not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of their doing. So the conſtancie and truth of God is called not repenting, and when he alters that which hee hath <pb n="114" facs="tcp:14442:218"/>done, repentance is attributed vnto him, as of making man, and of making
<hi>Saul</hi> King. Yet this is to be remembred, that when God changeth things, the change is in the things, not in God, who determined the change of ſuch things before the foundation of the world.</p>
                  <p>The meaning then is, that God neuer repents him of the giuing of ſauing grace to them whom he loues, and of electing them at the firſt, he holds his gifts well beſtowed, he giues not to day, and takes away to morrow. According to this is that of <hi>Eſau,</hi> who ſought repentance with teares, but found no place for it. which is not meant of his own repentance for ſin, but of his fathers repentance concerning the bleſſing: Hee would haue had his father haue changed his minde and made a new will, but his father would not.</p>
                  <p>There are three things which cauſe men to repent of their doings, and to alter their purpoſes, none of which are in God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Mutabilitie of mind, but there is no variableneſſe with God, but he is euer the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Error through ignorance, which cauſeth new conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, ſome things being miſtaken, or ſome impediments happening not foreſeene, but in God is neither errour nor ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Impotencie, when we are not able to bring to effect, our purpoſed intendments: but God is almightie, therefore his gifts and calling are without repentance, and by conſequence hauing elected and called the Iewes to be his people; ſaluation and a time of conuerſion muſt needes bee laid vp in ſtore for them.</p>

The ſecond are ſuch, who haue onely a ſhew of Religion, theſe are hypocrites. 3. Such who haue true grace, but it is temporarie and continues not. A man may haue true grace without ſaluation, but not true ſauing grace. True grace is then ſauing when it continues.</p>
                  <p>This diſtinction of grace is gathered out of the Hebrewes, where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> That a man may be inlightned, partake of <pb n="116" facs="tcp:14442:219"/>the holy Ghoſt, and taſte of the good word of God, and of the powers of the life to come, and yet be a caſt-away. Now ſuch graces were true, but temporarie: ſo the ſtony and thornie ground had true grace, but not continuing, which is the note of good ground.</p>
                  <p>Examine then the grace thou haſt. Thou haſt true ioy and ſorrow: as at a Sermon thou art truly affected with that which thou heareſt, being mooued to ioy at the hearing of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and it may bee to mourning, at the hearing of the threatnings againſt thy ſinnes Doe theſe things continue? or art thou Sermon-ſicke, as a man is ſea-ſicke: ſicke at ſea, and well at ſhore? a penitent within the Church, and prophane without? If theſe continue not, they are no ſauing graces.</p>
                  <p>Thou haſt true feare: as in the time of thunder or other danger: but it may be thy feare is ouerblowne with the cloud: thou wert truely afraid, but it muſt continue if a ſauing grace.</p>
                  <p>In proſperitie many beleeue in God, and in aduerſitie flye to the Diuell. This may be true faith but is not ſauing. Sauing faith is like a true friend who failes not in aduerſitie, which makes a man ſay,
<hi>Though he kill me, I will truſt in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou haſt true loue, as to the world and to godlineſſe in godly folke: but it may be thou loueſt theſe as <hi>Saul</hi> loued
<hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid. Dauid</hi> muſt be ſent for, and who but <hi>Dauid?</hi> How long? till the euill ſpirit come vpon <hi>Saul:</hi> ſo many loue theſe things till the ill ſpirit come vpon them, and then they ſhew that they haue not ſauing grace.</p>
                  <p>Many haue true reſolution, as in time of ſickneſſe to amend their liues: they will ſpeake ſo well then, as a man would think they ſpake as they meant, and ſo they do, as they meane then; but their meaning changes, and when they are recouered, their minde is altered, therefore ſuch reſolutions though true, yet are not ſauing. We loue ſtuffe in our garments that will laſt, and mettall in a horſe that will laſt: ſome horſe will at firſt ſetting out ſtand vpon no ground, and yet be ſtarke tired be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noone; we like not ſuch a horſe, nor doth God like ſuch profeſſors, whoſe graces doe not continue.</p>

                  <p>HEere is the laſt Argument to proue the Conuerſion and generall calling of the Iewes, which is furrher confirmed, verſ 32.</p>
                  <p>The Argument is taken from the like dealing of God with the Gentiles: God after a long time of infidelitie receiued the Gentiles to mercie: therefore will hee alſo at laſt receiue the Iewes; for (according to the rule) of things like, there is the ſame iudgement. The impiety of the Gentiles was no impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment to their mercie: neither ſhall the infidelity of the Iewes to theirs.</p>
                  <p>One accounts this Argument probable, not neceſſary,

                  <p>In the Propoſition are three things. 1. The ſtate the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were in, in times paſt: <hi>They haue not beleeued God.</hi> There is a double infidelitie Naturall, Iudiciall, the Gentiles were vnder both. Infidelitie may alſo be conſidered as oppoſed to Chriſtianitie: ſo we Chriſtians are not vnbeleeuers: or as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to faith, and ſo we are borne vnbeleeuers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their preſent eſtate, <hi>Terminus ad quem. They haue now obtained mercie,</hi> that is, Faith, which hee ſhould haue ſpoken, but he rather choſe to ſay mercie; both becauſe faith is of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, as of the cauſe, and alſo becauſe the proper act of Faith is to receiue mercie.</p>

                  <p>THere haue beene many queſtions about the meaning of theſe words, ariſing from the differing pointing of it: as whether the
<hi>Inciſum,</hi> be to follow <hi>beleeued,</hi> or <hi>your mercy,</hi> and ſo whether <hi>(through your mercie)</hi> be to be read to the firſt clauſe of the verſe, or the ſecond.</p>

                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:14442:221"/> They that haue read it to the firſt:

                     </note> haue ſome of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded your mercy, of Chriſt, called our mercy as he is our peace, becauſe the author of theſe things: but this cannot be the meaning becauſe of the termes of the ſimilitude; and it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees not with the words.</p>
                  <p>Others expound that becauſe god ſhewed the Gentiles mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy therefore the Iewes beleeued not but this is falſe,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eraſmus.</hi>
                     </note> for firſt they refuſed to beleeue, and then the Gentiles were called.</p>
                  <p>Others giue this meaning,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aquin.</hi>
                     </note> that the Iewes beleeued not, that the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles might obtaine mercy: but this was ſayd before
<hi>ver.</hi> 30. And therefore not the ſame muſt here be ment, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to anſwere vnto it.</p>
                  <p>To auoid theſe impertinent expoſitions, the right is, to read it according to his Maieſties tranſlation, where there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary trajection of this word <hi>(that)</hi> which word if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Iewes, notes the euent: but if to the counſell of God, as is beſt, here it notes the end.</p>
                  <p>Here there are three things of the Iewes; anſwerable to the thre things ſpoken of the Gentiles <hi>ver.</hi> 3. 1. The Gentiles were in an eſtate of vnbeleefe, the Iewes <hi>are in ſuch an estate.</hi> 2. The Gentiles <hi>haue receiued mercy.</hi> The Iewes <hi>ſhall.</hi> 3. The Gentiles receiued mercie, by the <hi>vnbeleefe of the Iewes;</hi> the Iewes ſhall receiue mercy, <hi>by the mercy ſhewed to the Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the argument is, that as God hath dealt with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, ſo will he deale with the Iew, and this is brought in to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the pride of the Gentiles, who deſpiſed the Iewes, as if there were no mercie for ſuch wretches. Now (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thy ſelfe thou Gentile, what wert thou before thou wert called? wert thou not a worſhipper of diuels, in a grieuous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of ſinne? If then there was mercie for thee, why not for them? Why ſhould their infidelitie be a greater impediment to them, then thine was to thee? Nay, there is more likelihood of their calling then was of thine, in regard of the occaſionall meanes; for thou cameſt in by their vnbeleefe: they ſhall come in by thy faith, which is more effectuall for the bringing of ſuch a thing to paſſe.</p>

Surely the preſeruation of that people in the prouidence of God (notwithſtanding all their affliction) to be a people diſtinguiſhed, not only in name and apparell, but in cuſtomes, ceremonies, religion, from all other nations, argues, that God hath ſome good purpoſe to them; becauſe we ſee the Troians, Vandals, Hunns, and diuers other nations to be quite entinguiſhed, eſpecially for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction from other people.

                  <p>SAint <hi>Paul</hi> in the two former verſes, brought a ſimilitude to proue the calling of the Iewes: now becauſe ſimilitudes doe more illuſtrate then proue, therefore he in this verſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes the parity of Gods dealing with the Iew, as with the Gentile, from the end of Gods purpoſe in the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The end of Gods concluding Gentiles and Iewes in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie was not to deſtroy them, but to ſhew mercie on them. Therfore if the Gentiles obtaine this end ſo a ſo ſhal the Iew: and thus he concludes this matter as he began it, that Gods end in caſting off the Iewes, is not their deſtruction, but the ſaluation both of Gentile, and alſo of Iew, as verſ. 11.</p>
                  <p>In this verſe are two things. 1. A Propoſition, <hi>God hath concluded all in vnbeleefe.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>In the Propoſition are, firſt the Action, ſecondly, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>The Action, <hi>Concluding in vnbeleefe,</hi> a metaphoricall ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, where vnbeleefe is compared to a chaine, or rather a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in the which men are concluded, till it pleaſe God to haue mercie on them, giuing them faith.</p>
                  <p>The perſons are twofold: 1. Committing: 2. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                  <p>The perſon committing or concluding, is <hi>God</hi> moſt iuſt, and moſt mercifull.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt. But is not God hereby made guiltie of their Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No: no more then a Iudge committing a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor to priſon is guiltie of his fault.

                  <p>Heere is an elegant ſimilitude.

                  <p>IN theſe three verſes, and in the laſt, is a ſolemne concluſion of the things before deliuered, in the ninth, tenth, and this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Hee hath ſpoken of many difficult points, as Election, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, Reiection of the Iewes, calling of the Gentiles, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling of the Iewes; he hath anſwered many queſtions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented many cauils, ſatisfied many doubts: here he religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maketh a ſtop, admiring the wiſdome of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:14442:225"/>And high time was it for <hi>Paul</hi> ſo to doe: for in the 32 ver. he had deliuered a ſecret enough to haue ſwallowed vp any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated vnderſtanding: and therfore there he breaks of, putting in a barre, againſt all further quarels which might be made falling into admiration of the infinite wiſdome of God in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of things. As a man wading into the ſea, when he comes vp to the neck, and feeles the water begin to heaue him vp, and his feete to fayle him, cries out, O the depth and goes backe, ſo it fares with <hi>Paul</hi> in this place; and it is as if he ſhould haue ſayd thus.</p>
                  <p>O you Romaines, and my countrymen the Iewes, I haue writ vnto you of theſe things as far as I can; for the reſt I am ſwallowed vp, being more vnable to paſſe farther into this bottomleſſe, then to wade through the depth of the ſea. Ceaſe therefore to put more queſtions, &amp; admire with me the depth of the wiſdome of God.</p>
                  <p>In theſe words are two things. 1. A propoſition. 2. A reaſon. The propoſition is in the latter end of the 33 verſe. <hi>How vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerchable are his iudgments, and his wayes paſt finding out,</hi> ſet downe with admiration, <hi>how vnſerchable,</hi> which being plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliuered is this. The Iudgements and wayes of God are moſt vnſerchable. The words are ſignificant as can be, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the matter cannot be conteyned in any words, therefore he admires, <hi>How vnſerchable.</hi> A greater depth then can be ſadomed with mans reaſon, or expreſſed in any words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The iudgments:</hi> Iudgments are vſually taken for the works of God vindicatiue Iuſtice and ſeuerity whereby he puniſheth ſinners: but here for Gods whole prouidence, ruling or orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the affayres of the world, called iudgments, becauſe to iudge is a principall action of a Ruler. The adminiſtration of things whether God ſhew Iuſtice or mercy, is thus called of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Pſalmes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vnſearchable:</hi> That is ſo deepely hid, that no man can find out or vnderſtand, farther then God reueales, and then to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the reaſon vnpoſſible. As it is not poſſible for vs to find thoſe things which are about the Center of the earth, ſo a thowſand times farther are theſe things from vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His wayes,</hi> Sometimes his commaundements are ſo called, <pb n="130" facs="tcp:14442:226"/>but ſuch are found out in his word. Wayes therefore of God, are not the wayes the creature walkes towards the Creator, but the wayes of the Creator towards the creature. Heere the ſame thing I take it is meant by waies, which before by iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by an Ingemination familiar to the Hebrews, though ſome (and that diuerſly) doe curiouſly diſtinguiſh them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Past finding out:</hi> A metaphor from quick-ſented Hounds, who are at a loſſe, hauing neither foot-ſtep nor ſent left, of the game they purſue. None can trace the Lord, and finde out the way and reaſon of his doings. As none can line out the way of a Serpent ouer a ſtone, or of a ſhippe on the waues, or of an arrow in the ayre: ſo neither find the wayes which God walkes in, in the gouernment of things.</p>
                  <p>This propoſition is confirmed by reaſon, which is twofold; Firſt, from the excellencie of God, verſe 33. Secondly. From the deficiencie of man, verſ. 34.35.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is ſet down with exclamation. <hi>O the depth of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, of the wiſdom &amp; knowledge of God!</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, his wiſdome is infinit. Arguiug thus: whoſe wiſdome is infinite, his wayes are vnſearchable: But Gods wiſdom is infinit: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The three Genitiues, are by ſome applied to three Diuine properties, Mercie, Iuſtice, and knowledge. But I take it that the firſt Genitiue <hi>(of the riches)</hi> is added to <hi>(the depth)</hi> by an exceſſe of ſpeaking, ſignifying the ſame thing in effect, which exceedingly becomes that matter, which no words can ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſignifie.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Deph,</hi> is infiniteneſſe, and abſtruſeneſſe not to bee attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as the bottome of the vaſte Ocean. By <hi>Riches</hi> meant, an infiniteneſſe of excellencie not to bee numbred, counted valued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wiſdome and knowledge,</hi> as they differ not in God, ſo heere they may be ſafely taken for the ſame, remembring this, that all the diuine properties are of the ſame extent of excellencie: of euery of which it may be ſaid, <hi>O the depth of the riches!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wiſedome and knowledge of God,</hi> actiuely, not paſſiuely to be vnderſtood; which are otherwiſe in God, then wiſdome and knowledge in vs. In vs they are ſeparable, wee receiue them by gift, and haue them by communication; not <pb n="131" facs="tcp:14442:226"/>ſo in God: He deriues his knowledge from none, but is the fountaine of all wiſdome in himſelfe and in his creatures; it is his Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>We know but little, and that by degrees taking out one leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon after another: But God knowes himſelfe, the Trinitie, his creatures, all things paſt, preſent, and to come; open, ſecret, certeine, contingent; that that ſhall be, that which neuer ſhall be; and theſe perfectly, not by <hi>ſpecies</hi> and relation, but by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, not
<hi>per prius</hi> and <hi>poſterius,</hi> by collection, diſcourſe, but in an inſtant, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Argument is taken from the Deficiencie of man, which is double, Firſt, of Knowledge, verſ. 34. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of righteouſneſſe, verſ. 35.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, <hi>None hath knowne his minde:</hi> He hath not called any man to counſell, either to aske or communicate counſels. This is taken out of Eſay 40.13.14. Nor man, nor Angell is admitted hereunto.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Deficiencie is of Iuſtice: <hi>Who hath giuen him firſt, and it ſhall be recompenſed:</hi> that is, None can challenge God that hee is indebted to him: were God beholding to a man, then it might be tolerated that ſuch a man might aske a reaſon why God doth this or that: but God owes vs nothing more then he pleaſe to promiſe of his owne meere goodneſſe: and therefore he neuer need or aske vs leaue or render a reaſon of his wayes and gouernment of the world. Learned men point vs heere to <hi>Iob</hi> 41.2. and I thinke hee may as well alledge <hi>Iob</hi> 35.7. if any thing in that booke.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two are ſet downe by Interrogation, ſo much the more to conuince man of his paruitie and nothingneſſe in compariſon of God.</p>
                  <p>This Reaſon in theſe two branches of it, confirmes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition thus: For men to ſearch the reaſon of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is for blind men to Iudge of colours: and for men to finde fault or queſtion Gods doings, is as though God were beholding to man: But men faile in knowledge, and God is not indebted to them, therefore it is neither poſſible nor law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to ſearch the hidden wayes of God.</p>

                  <p>When the calling of the Iewes is preached: ſome ſay it is not poſſible, ſome ſay it is not likely: ſome, why did the Lord thus to the Gentiles, thus to the Iewes?

                  <p>To be ſearching and inquiring further then is reuealed, or the reaſon of ſuch myſteries, is not profitable.</p>
                  <p>It is reported, that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> on a time walking by the ſea ſide, and beating his head to find out a reaſon of the Trinitie, lift vp his eyes and ſpied a childe, with a ſpoone kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching water out of the ſea into a little hole: Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> askes the childe why he did ſo; he anſwered, to emptie the ſea into that hole: at which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſmiled, telling him it could not be done. So, good father, ſaith the childe, you buſie your braines about the Trinitie, and though you take <pb n="133" facs="tcp:14442:227"/>more paines then I, yet your ſucceſſe ſhall be alike. The wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of man is no more able to comprehend the Iudgements and wayes of God, then the skull of man is able to hold in it the whole water of the ſea. To ſtate earneſtly vpon the Sun, is the way to loſe our ſight, not to encreaſe it, not to ſee more, but not to ſee at all. So the way to vnderſtand and to attaine wiſdome, is not to be too buſie in ſearching, but to content our ſelues with that which is reuealed.
