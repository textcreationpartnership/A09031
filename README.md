1. AN EXPOSITION vpon the eighth, ninth, tenth, and the eleuenth Chapters of the Epiſtle to the ROMANES.

    _ CHAP. VIII.

      * VERSE. 1.There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Ieſus, who walke not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.

      * VERSE 2.For the Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Ieſus, hath made me free from the Law of Sinne, and Death.

      * VERSE 3.For what the Law could not doe, in that it was weake through the fleſh; GOD ſending his owne Son in the likenes of ſinfull fleſh, and for ſin;Or, by a ſacrifice for ſin.condemned ſinne in the Fleſh:4.That the righteouſneſſe of the Law might bee fulfilled in vs, who walke not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.

      * VERSE 4.That the Righteouſneſſe of the Law might be fulfilled in vs, which walke not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.

      * VERSE 5.For they that are after the fleſh, doe mind the things of the fleſh, but they that are after the ſpirit, the things of the ſpirit.6.For toOr, the minding of the fleſh.be carnally minded is death, but toor, the minding of the ſpirit.bee ſpiritually minded is life and peace.7.Becauſeor, the minding of the fleſh.the carnall mind is enmity againſt God: for it is not ſubiect to the Law of GOD, neither indeed can bee.

      * VERSE. 6.For to be Carnally minded is Death: but to be Spiritually minded is life and peace.

      * VERSE 7.Becauſe the Carnall minde is Enmitie againſt God: for it is not ſubiect to the Law of God, nor indeed can be.

      * VERSE 8.So then they that are in the Fleſh, cannot pleaſe GOD.

      * VERSE 9.But yee are not in the fleſh, but in the spirit, if ſo bee that the ſpirit of God dwelleth in you, &c.And ſo to the end of the 11. verſe.

      * VERSE 10.And if Chriſt be in you, the bodie is dead becauſe of ſinne, but the ſpirit is life for righteouſneſſe ſake.

      * VERSE 11.But if the Spirit of him, which raiſed vp Ieſus from the Dead, dwell in you; he that raiſed vp Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortall bodiesOr, becauſe of his Spirit.by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.

      * VERSE. 12.Therefore, brethren, we are debters, not to the Fleſh, to liue after the Fleſh.Verſe 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

      * VERSE 13.For if yee liue after the Fleſh, ye ſhall dye: but if ye through the Spirit doe mortifie the deeds of the body, yee ſhall liue.

      * VERSE 14.For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the ſonnes of God.

      * VERSE 15.For yee haue not receiued the ſpirit of bondage againe to feare; but yee haue receiued the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father.

      * VERSE 16.The Spirit it ſelfe beareth witneſſe with our ſpirit, that we are the Children of God.

      * VERSE 17.And if Children, then Heyres: Heyres of God, and Ioynt-heyres with Chriſt. If ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified together.

      * VERSE 18.For I reckon that the ſuffrings of this preſent time, are not worthy of the glorie to be reuealed in vs.

      * VERSE 19.For the earneſt expectation of the Creature, waiteth for the manifeſtation of the Sonnes of God.20.For the creature was made ſubiect to vanitie, not willingly, but by reaſon of him who hath ſubiected the ſame in hope.21.Becauſe the Creature it ſelfe alſo ſhall bee deliuered from the bondage of Corruption, into the glorious libertie of the Children of God.22.For we know thatOr euery Creature.the whole Creation groneth, and trauelleth in paine together, vntill now.23.And not onely they, but our ſelues alſo, which haue the firſt fruits of the Spirit, euen we our ſelues grone within our ſelues, waiting for the Adoption, to wit, the Redemption of our Body.

      * VERSE 21.Becauſe the Creature it ſelfe alſo, &c.

      * VERSE 23.And not onely they, but our ſelues alſo which haue the firſt fruits of the Spirit. Euen wee our ſelues, groane within our ſelues, waiting for the Adoption, to wit, theLuc. 21.28.Redemption of our body.

      * VERSE 24.For we are ſaued by Hope: but Hope that is ſeene is not Hope: for what a man ſeeth, why doth hee yet hope for?25.But if we hope for that we ſee not, then doe wee with Patience wait for it.

      * VERE 26.Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our Infirmities: for we know not what wee ſhould pray for as we ought: but the Spirit it ſelfe maketh interceſsion for vs with gronings which cannot be vttered.

      * Verſe 26.For wee know not what wee ſhould pray for as we ought: but the Spirit it ſelfe maketh interceſſion for vs with gronings which cannot be vttered.

      * VERSE 27.And he that ſearcheth the hearts, knoweth what is in the mind of the Spirit,Or, that.becauſe he maketh interceſſion for the Saints according to the will of God.

      * VERSE 28.And wee know that all things worke together for good to them that loue God, to them who are called according to his purpoſe.

      * VERSE 29.For whom he did fore-know, he alſo did predeſtinate, to be conformed to the Image of his Sonne, that hee might be the firſt-borne among many Brethren.

      * VERSE 30.Moreouer whom hee did predeſtinate, them hee alſo called, and whom he called, them hee alſo iuſtified: and whom he iuſtified, them he alſo glorified.

      * VERSE 31.What ſhall we then ſay to theſe things? If God be for vs? Who can be againſt vs?32.He that ſpared not, &c.to the end of the Chapter.

      * VERSE 32.Hee that ſpared not his owne Sonne, but deliuered him vp for vs: how ſhall hee not with him alſo freely giue vs all things?

      * VERSE 33.Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that Iuſtifieth.

      * VERSE 34.Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that dyed, yea rather that is riſen againe, who is euen at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh Interceſſion for vs.

      * VERSE 35.Who ſhall ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt? ſhall tribulation, or diſtreſſe, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſſe, or perill, or ſword?

      * VERSE 36.As it is written,Pſal 44.22.For thy ſake, are wee killed all the day long, wee are accounted as ſheepe for the ſlaughter.

      * VERSE 37.Nay, in all theſe things wee are more then Conquerors, through him that loued vs.

      * VERSE 38.For I am perſwaded, that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come,39.Nor height, nor depth, nor any other Creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate vs from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.

      * VERSE 1.I ſay the truth in Chriſt, I lye not, my conſcience alſo bearing me witneſſe in the holy Ghoſt.2.That I haue great heauineſſe and continuall ſorrow in my heart.

      * VERSE 2.That I haue great heauineſſe, and continuall ſorrow in my heart.

      * VERSE 1.I ſay the Truth in Chriſt, I lye not, my Conſcience alſo bearing me witneſſe in the holy Ghoſt.

      * VERSE 3.For I could wiſh that may ſelfe wereOr ſeparated.accurſed from Chriſt, for my brethren, my kinſmen according to the Fleſh.

      * VERSE 4.Who are Iſraelites: to whome pertaineth the Adoption, and the Glorie, and theOr Teſtaments.Couenants, and the giuing of the Law, and the ſeruice of God, and the promiſes.5.Whoſe are the Fathers, and of whome as concerning the Fleſh, Christ came, who is ouer all, God bleſſed for euer, Amen.

      * VERSE 6.Not as though the Word of God hath taken none effect, &c.

      * VERSE 7.Neither becauſe they are the ſeede of Abraham, are they all children:Gen. 21.12.but in
Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called.8.That is, they which are the Children of the fleſh, theſe are not the children of God: but the children of the Promiſe are counted for the ſeede.9.Gen. 18.10.For this is the word of Promiſe; At this time will I come, and Sara ſhall haue a ſonne.

      * VERSE 10.And not onely this, but when
Rebecca alſo had conceiued by one, euen by our Father
Iſaac,11.(For the children beeing not yet borne, neither hauing done any good or euill, that the purpoſe of God, according to Election, might ſtand, not of works, but of him that calleth)12.It was ſaid vnto her,Gen. 25.23.Or Greater.The Elder ſhall ſerue theOr Younger.Younger;13.As it is written,Mal. 1.2.Iacob haue I loued, but Eſau haue I hated.

      * VERSE 11.(For the children being not yet borne, neither hauing done any good or euill, that the purpoſe of God according to election might ſtand, not of workes, but of him that calleth.)

      * VERSE 14.What ſhal we ſay then? Is there vnrighteouſneſſe with God? God forbid.15.For he ſaith to
MoſesExod. 33.19.:
I will haue mercy, on whom I will haue mercy, and I will haue compaſſion, on whom I will haue compaſſion.16.So then, it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.

      * VERSE 17.For the Scripture ſaith vnto
Pharaoh:Exod. 9.16.Euen for this ſame purpoſe haue I raiſed thee vp: that I might ſhew my power in thee, and that my Name might be declared throughout all the earth.

      * VERSE 18.Therefore he hath mercy, on whom he will haue mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.

      * VERSE 19.Thou ſhalt ſay vnto me, Why doth he yet finde fault? for who hath reſiſted his will?and ſo to the end of the 23. verſe.

      * VERSE 20.Nay, but O man, who art thou thatOr anſwereſt againe, or diſputeſt with God.replyeſt againſt God? Shall the thing formed, ſay to him that formed itEſay 45.9., Why haſt thou made me thus?21.Hath not the PotterIer. 8.6. Wiſd.
15.7.power ouer the Clay, of the ſame lumpe to make one veſſell vnto honour, and another vnto diſhonour.

      * VERSE 22.What if God, willing to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power knowne, indured with long ſuffering the veſſels of wrathOr made vp.fitted to destruction,23.And that hee might make knowne the riches of his glory, on the veſſels of glory, which hee had afore prepared vnto glory?

      * VERSE 22.Indured with long-ſuffering the veſſels of Wrath.

      * VERSE 22.To ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known.

      * VERSE 23.And that hee might make knowne the riches of his glory, on the veſſels of mercy.

      * VERSE 24.Euen vs whom he hath called, not of the Iewes only, but alſo of the Gentiles.

      * VERSE 25.As he ſaith alſo in
Oſee,Oſe. 2.23I will call them My people, which were not my people,1. Pet. 2.10.and her Beloued, which was not beloued.26.And it ſhall come to paſſe, that in the place where it was ſaid vnto them,Oſe. 1.10Yee are not my people, there they ſhall be called the children of the liuing GOD.

      * VERSE 27.Eſay 10.22.23Eſay alſo cryeth concerning Iſrael, Though the Number of the children of Iſrael bee as the ſand of the Sea, a Remnant ſhall be ſaued.28.For he will finiſh theOr account.worke, and cut it ſhort in righteouſneſſe, becauſe a ſhort worke will the Lord make vpon the earth.29.And as Eſaias ſaid before,Eſay 1.9.Except the Lord of Sabbath had left vs a ſeede, we had beene as Sodoma, and beene made like vnto Gomorrah.

      * VERSE 30.What ſhall wee ſay then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after Righteouſneſſe, haue attained to Righteouſnes, euen the Righteouſneſſe which is of faith.31.But Iſrael which followed after the law of Righteouſneſſe, hath not attained to the law of Righteouſneſſe.32.Wherefore? becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the workes of the law.

      * VERSE 32.For they ſtumbled at the ſtumbling ſtone,33.As it is written,Eſay 8.14. &
18.16. 1 Pet. 2.6.Behold, I lay in Sion a ſtumbling ſtone, and Rocke of offence, and whoſoeuer beleeueth on him, ſhall not beOr, confounded.aſhamed.

      * VERSE 1.Brethren, my hearts deſire and prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they might be ſaued.

      * VERSE 2.For I beare them record, that they haue a zeale of God, but not according to knowledge.

      * VERSE 2.For they being ignorant of Gods righteouſnes, and going about to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe, haue not ſubmitted themſelues to the righteouſnes of God.

      * VERSE 4.For Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to euery one that beleeueth.

      * VERSE 5.For Moſes deſcribeth the righteouſneſſe which is of the Lawe, thatLeuit. 18.5. Ezech.
20.11. Gal. 3.12.the man which doth thoſe things ſhall liue by them.6.But the righteouſneſſe which is of faith, ſpeaketh on this wiſe;Deut. 30.12.Say not in thy heart, Who ſhall aſcend into Heauen? That is, to bring Chriſt downe from aboue.7.Or, Who ſhall deſcend into the Deepe? that is to bring vp Christ againe from the dead.8.But what ſayth it?Deut. 30.14.The Word is nigh thee, euen in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that is the Word of faith which we preach.

      * VERSE 9.That if thou ſhalt confeſſe with thy mouth the Lord Ieſus, and ſhalt beleeue in thy heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaued.10.For with the heart man beleeueth vnto righteouſneſſe, and with the mouth confeſsion is made vnto ſaluation.

      * VERSE 11.For the Scripture ſaith,Eſay 28.16.Whoſoeuer belieueth on him, ſhall not be aſhamed.

      * VERSE 12.For there is no difference betweene the Iew and the Greeke: for the ſame Lord ouer all, is rich vnto all that call vpon him.

      * VERSE 13.Ioel. 2.32. Act.
2.21.For whoſoeuer ſhall call on the Name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaued.

      * VERSE 14.How then ſhall they call on him, in whom they haue not belieued? and how ſhall they belieue in him of whom they haue not heard? and how ſhall they heare without a Preacher?15.And how ſhall they preach except they be ſent? as it is written,Eſay 52.7. Naum.
1.15.How beautifull are the feet of them, that preach the Goſpel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things?16.But they haue not all obeyed the Goſpel: For Eſayas ſaith,Eſay 53.1. Iohn
12.38.Lord, who hath belieued ourOr Preaching. Gr. the hearing of vs.report?17.So then, Faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.

      * VERSE 15.As it is written, How beautifull are the feete of thoſe which preach the Goſpell of Peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!

      * VERSE 16.But they haue not all obeyed the Goſpell, for Eſayas ſaith, Lord, who hath belieued our report?

      * VERSE 18.But I ſay, Haue they not heard? Yes verily,Pſal. 19.4.their ſound went into all the earth, and their words vnto the ends of the world.

      * VERSE 19.But I ſay, did not Iſrael know? Firſt, Moſes ſaith,Deut. 32.31.I will prouoke you to iealouſie by them that are no people, and by a fooliſh Nation I will anger you.

      * VERSE 20.But Eſayas is very bold, and ſaith;Eſay. 65.1.I was found of them that ſought me not: I was made manifeſt vnto them that asked not after me.

      * VERSE 21.But to Iſrael hee ſaith,Eſay. 65.2.All day long I haue ſtretched out my hands to a diſobedient and gaineſaying people.

      * VERS. 1.I ſay then, Hath God caſt away his people? God forbid. For I alſo am an Iſraelite, of the ſeed of Abraham, of the tribe of Beniamin.

      * VERSE 2.For I alſo am an Iſraelite, of the ſeed of Abraham, of the tribe of Beniamin.

      * VERS. 2.God hath not caſt away his people which he foreknew.

      * VERSE 2.Wote you not what the ſcripture ſaith of Elias? How be maketh intercesſion to GOD againſt
Iſrael, ſaying.3Lord they haue killed thy prophets, and digged downe thine Alters, and I am left alone, and they ſeeke my life.4But what ſayth the anſwere of God vnto him. I haue reſerued to my ſelfe 7000 men who haue not bowed the knee to the Image of Baal.

      * VERSE. 2.How he makes interceſsion to God againſt Iſraell ſaying.

      * VERSE 3.Lord they haue killed thy Prophets, and digged downe thine Altars; and I am left alone, and they ſeeke my life.

      * VERSE. 4.But what ſayth the anſwere of God vnto him? I haue reſerued to my ſelfe 7000 men who haue not bowed the knee to the Image of Baal.

      * VERSE. 4.I haue reſerued to my ſelfe
7000 men who haue not bowed the knee to the Image of Baal.

      * VERSE 5.Euen ſo at this preſent time alſo there is a remnant, according to the election of Grace.

      * VERSE. 6.And if by Grace, then is it no more of workes, otherwiſe Grace were no more Grace? But if it be of workes, then is it no more grace, otherwiſe worke is no more worke.

      * VERSE. 7.What then? Iſrael hath not obtained that which he ſeeketh for, but the election hath obtained it, and the reſt were blinded.Or hardned.

      * VERSE 8.According as it is written,Eſay 29.10.God hath giuen them the ſpirit of ſlumber,or remorſe.eyes that they ſhould not ſee,Eſay. 6.9.& eares that they ſhould not heare vnto this day.

      * VERSE 9.And Dauid ſaithPſal. 69.22.Let their table be made a ſnare, and a trap, and a ſtumbling blocke, and a recompence vnto them.10.Pſal. 69.23.Let their eyes be darkned that they may not ſee, and bow downe their backe alway.

      * VERSE 11.I ſay then; Haue they ſtumbled that they ſhould fall? God forbid, but rather through their fall ſaluation is come to the Gentiles, to prouke them to Idolatry.

      * VERSE 12.Now if the fall of them be the Riches of the world, and the diminiſhing of them,Or decay, or loſſe.the riches of the Gentiles: How much more their fulneſſe?

      * VERSE. 13.For I ſpeake to you Gentiles, in as much as I am the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, I magnifie mine office.14.If by any meanes I may prouoke to emulation, them which are my fleſh, and might ſaue ſome of them.

      * VERSE 15.For if the caſting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what ſhall the receiuing of them be, but life from the dead?

      * VERSE 16.For if the firſt fruite be holy, the lumpe is alſo holy: and if the roote be holy, ſo are the branches.

      * VERSE. 17.And if ſome of the branches be broken off, and thou being a wild oliue tree, wert graffed in a mongſt them. And with them partakeſt of the root and fatnes of the oliue tree.18.Boaſt not thy ſelfe againſt the branches: but if thou boaſt thou beareſt not the root, but the root thee.

      * VERSE. 19.Thou wilt ſay then, the branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.20Well, becauſe of vnbeleefe they were broken off, and thou ſtandeſt by faith: Bee not high minded, but feare.

      * VERSE. 20.—Be not high minded but feare.

      * VERSE 20.—But feare.

      * VERSE 21.For if God ſpared not the naturall branches, take heed leſt he alſo ſpare not thee.

      * VERSE. 22.Behold therefore the goodnes and ſeuerity of God; on them which fell, ſeuerity: but towards thee, goodneſſe, if thou continue in his goodneſſe: otherwiſe thou alſo ſhalt be cut off.

      * VERSE. 23.And they alſo if they bide not ſtill in vnbeleefe, ſhall be graffed in, for God is able to graffe them in againe.

      * VERSE. 24.For if thou wert cut out of the Oliue tree, which is wilde by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good Oliue tree: how much more ſhal theſe which be the Naturall branches bee graffed, into their tree?

      * VERSE 25.For I would not brethren that ye ſhould be ignorant of this mystery, left you ſhould be wiſe in your owne conceits, that blindneſſeor hardneſſe.in part is hapned to Iſrael, vntill the fulneſſe of the Gentiles be come in.26.And ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaued.

      * VERSE. 26.As it is written,Eſay. 59 20.then ſhall come out of Syon the deliuerer, and ſhall turne away vngodlines from
Iacob.27For this is my couenant vnto them, when I ſhall take away their ſinnes.

      * VERSE 28.As concerning the Goſpell, they are enemies for your ſake: but as touching the election, they are beloued for the fathers ſakes.

      * VERSE 29.For the gifts and calling of God, are without repentance.

      * VERSE. 30.For as yee in times paſt, haue not beleeuedOr obeyed.God, yet haue now obtained mercy through their vnbeleefe.31.Euen ſo haue theſe alſo now not beleeued,Or obeyed.that through your mercie, they alſo may obtaine mercie.

      * VERSE 31.Euen ſo haue theſe alſo now not beleeued,Or obeyed.that through your mercie they alſo might obtaine mercie.

      * VERSE. 32.For God hath concluded them all in vnbeleefe,Or ſhutte them all vp together.that he might haue mercie on all.

      * VERSE 32.—That he might haue mercie on all.

      * VERSE 33.O the depth of the riches, both of the wiſdome and knowledge of God! How vnſearchable are his iudgments, and his wayes paſt finding out!34.Eſay 40.13. Wiſd. 9.13. 1. Cor.
2.16.For who hath knowne the mind of the Lord, or who hath beene his counſeller?35.Or who hath firſt giuen him, and it ſhall be recompenſed him againe?

      * VERSE 36.For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.

    _ THE NINTH CHAPTER OF THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANES.

      * VERSE. 1.There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Ieſus, who walke not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.

      * VERSE 2.For the Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Ieſus, hath made me free from the Law of Sinne, and Death.

      * VERSE 3.For what the Law could not doe, in that it was weake through the fleſh; GOD ſending his owne Son in the likenes of ſinfull fleſh, and for ſin;Or, by a ſacrifice for ſin.condemned ſinne in the Fleſh:4.That the righteouſneſſe of the Law might bee fulfilled in vs, who walke not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.

      * VERSE 4.That the Righteouſneſſe of the Law might be fulfilled in vs, which walke not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.

      * VERSE 5.For they that are after the fleſh, doe mind the things of the fleſh, but they that are after the ſpirit, the things of the ſpirit.6.For toOr, the minding of the fleſh.be carnally minded is death, but toor, the minding of the ſpirit.bee ſpiritually minded is life and peace.7.Becauſeor, the minding of the fleſh.the carnall mind is enmity againſt God: for it is not ſubiect to the Law of GOD, neither indeed can bee.

      * VERSE. 6.For to be Carnally minded is Death: but to be Spiritually minded is life and peace.

      * VERSE 7.Becauſe the Carnall minde is Enmitie againſt God: for it is not ſubiect to the Law of God, nor indeed can be.

      * VERSE 8.So then they that are in the Fleſh, cannot pleaſe GOD.

      * VERSE 9.But yee are not in the fleſh, but in the spirit, if ſo bee that the ſpirit of God dwelleth in you, &c.And ſo to the end of the 11. verſe.

      * VERSE 10.And if Chriſt be in you, the bodie is dead becauſe of ſinne, but the ſpirit is life for righteouſneſſe ſake.

      * VERSE 11.But if the Spirit of him, which raiſed vp Ieſus from the Dead, dwell in you; he that raiſed vp Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortall bodiesOr, becauſe of his Spirit.by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.

      * VERSE. 12.Therefore, brethren, we are debters, not to the Fleſh, to liue after the Fleſh.Verſe 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

      * VERSE 13.For if yee liue after the Fleſh, ye ſhall dye: but if ye through the Spirit doe mortifie the deeds of the body, yee ſhall liue.

      * VERSE 14.For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the ſonnes of God.

      * VERSE 15.For yee haue not receiued the ſpirit of bondage againe to feare; but yee haue receiued the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father.

      * VERSE 16.The Spirit it ſelfe beareth witneſſe with our ſpirit, that we are the Children of God.

      * VERSE 17.And if Children, then Heyres: Heyres of God, and Ioynt-heyres with Chriſt. If ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified together.

      * VERSE 18.For I reckon that the ſuffrings of this preſent time, are not worthy of the glorie to be reuealed in vs.

      * VERSE 19.For the earneſt expectation of the Creature, waiteth for the manifeſtation of the Sonnes of God.20.For the creature was made ſubiect to vanitie, not willingly, but by reaſon of him who hath ſubiected the ſame in hope.21.Becauſe the Creature it ſelfe alſo ſhall bee deliuered from the bondage of Corruption, into the glorious libertie of the Children of God.22.For we know thatOr euery Creature.the whole Creation groneth, and trauelleth in paine together, vntill now.23.And not onely they, but our ſelues alſo, which haue the firſt fruits of the Spirit, euen we our ſelues grone within our ſelues, waiting for the Adoption, to wit, the Redemption of our Body.

      * VERSE 21.Becauſe the Creature it ſelfe alſo, &c.

      * VERSE 23.And not onely they, but our ſelues alſo which haue the firſt fruits of the Spirit. Euen wee our ſelues, groane within our ſelues, waiting for the Adoption, to wit, theLuc. 21.28.Redemption of our body.

      * VERSE 24.For we are ſaued by Hope: but Hope that is ſeene is not Hope: for what a man ſeeth, why doth hee yet hope for?25.But if we hope for that we ſee not, then doe wee with Patience wait for it.

      * VERE 26.Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our Infirmities: for we know not what wee ſhould pray for as we ought: but the Spirit it ſelfe maketh interceſsion for vs with gronings which cannot be vttered.

      * Verſe 26.For wee know not what wee ſhould pray for as we ought: but the Spirit it ſelfe maketh interceſſion for vs with gronings which cannot be vttered.

      * VERSE 27.And he that ſearcheth the hearts, knoweth what is in the mind of the Spirit,Or, that.becauſe he maketh interceſſion for the Saints according to the will of God.

      * VERSE 28.And wee know that all things worke together for good to them that loue God, to them who are called according to his purpoſe.

      * VERSE 29.For whom he did fore-know, he alſo did predeſtinate, to be conformed to the Image of his Sonne, that hee might be the firſt-borne among many Brethren.

      * VERSE 30.Moreouer whom hee did predeſtinate, them hee alſo called, and whom he called, them hee alſo iuſtified: and whom he iuſtified, them he alſo glorified.

      * VERSE 31.What ſhall we then ſay to theſe things? If God be for vs? Who can be againſt vs?32.He that ſpared not, &c.to the end of the Chapter.

      * VERSE 32.Hee that ſpared not his owne Sonne, but deliuered him vp for vs: how ſhall hee not with him alſo freely giue vs all things?

      * VERSE 33.Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that Iuſtifieth.

      * VERSE 34.Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that dyed, yea rather that is riſen againe, who is euen at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh Interceſſion for vs.

      * VERSE 35.Who ſhall ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt? ſhall tribulation, or diſtreſſe, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſſe, or perill, or ſword?

      * VERSE 36.As it is written,Pſal 44.22.For thy ſake, are wee killed all the day long, wee are accounted as ſheepe for the ſlaughter.

      * VERSE 37.Nay, in all theſe things wee are more then Conquerors, through him that loued vs.

      * VERSE 38.For I am perſwaded, that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come,39.Nor height, nor depth, nor any other Creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate vs from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.

      * VERSE 1.I ſay the truth in Chriſt, I lye not, my conſcience alſo bearing me witneſſe in the holy Ghoſt.2.That I haue great heauineſſe and continuall ſorrow in my heart.

      * VERSE 2.That I haue great heauineſſe, and continuall ſorrow in my heart.

      * VERSE 1.I ſay the Truth in Chriſt, I lye not, my Conſcience alſo bearing me witneſſe in the holy Ghoſt.

      * VERSE 3.For I could wiſh that may ſelfe wereOr ſeparated.accurſed from Chriſt, for my brethren, my kinſmen according to the Fleſh.

      * VERSE 4.Who are Iſraelites: to whome pertaineth the Adoption, and the Glorie, and theOr Teſtaments.Couenants, and the giuing of the Law, and the ſeruice of God, and the promiſes.5.Whoſe are the Fathers, and of whome as concerning the Fleſh, Christ came, who is ouer all, God bleſſed for euer, Amen.

      * VERSE 6.Not as though the Word of God hath taken none effect, &c.

      * VERSE 7.Neither becauſe they are the ſeede of Abraham, are they all children:Gen. 21.12.but in
Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called.8.That is, they which are the Children of the fleſh, theſe are not the children of God: but the children of the Promiſe are counted for the ſeede.9.Gen. 18.10.For this is the word of Promiſe; At this time will I come, and Sara ſhall haue a ſonne.

      * VERSE 10.And not onely this, but when
Rebecca alſo had conceiued by one, euen by our Father
Iſaac,11.(For the children beeing not yet borne, neither hauing done any good or euill, that the purpoſe of God, according to Election, might ſtand, not of works, but of him that calleth)12.It was ſaid vnto her,Gen. 25.23.Or Greater.The Elder ſhall ſerue theOr Younger.Younger;13.As it is written,Mal. 1.2.Iacob haue I loued, but Eſau haue I hated.

      * VERSE 11.(For the children being not yet borne, neither hauing done any good or euill, that the purpoſe of God according to election might ſtand, not of workes, but of him that calleth.)

      * VERSE 14.What ſhal we ſay then? Is there vnrighteouſneſſe with God? God forbid.15.For he ſaith to
MoſesExod. 33.19.:
I will haue mercy, on whom I will haue mercy, and I will haue compaſſion, on whom I will haue compaſſion.16.So then, it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.

      * VERSE 17.For the Scripture ſaith vnto
Pharaoh:Exod. 9.16.Euen for this ſame purpoſe haue I raiſed thee vp: that I might ſhew my power in thee, and that my Name might be declared throughout all the earth.

      * VERSE 18.Therefore he hath mercy, on whom he will haue mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.

      * VERSE 19.Thou ſhalt ſay vnto me, Why doth he yet finde fault? for who hath reſiſted his will?and ſo to the end of the 23. verſe.

      * VERSE 20.Nay, but O man, who art thou thatOr anſwereſt againe, or diſputeſt with God.replyeſt againſt God? Shall the thing formed, ſay to him that formed itEſay 45.9., Why haſt thou made me thus?21.Hath not the PotterIer. 8.6. Wiſd.
15.7.power ouer the Clay, of the ſame lumpe to make one veſſell vnto honour, and another vnto diſhonour.

      * VERSE 22.What if God, willing to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power knowne, indured with long ſuffering the veſſels of wrathOr made vp.fitted to destruction,23.And that hee might make knowne the riches of his glory, on the veſſels of glory, which hee had afore prepared vnto glory?

      * VERSE 22.Indured with long-ſuffering the veſſels of Wrath.

      * VERSE 22.To ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known.

      * VERSE 23.And that hee might make knowne the riches of his glory, on the veſſels of mercy.

      * VERSE 24.Euen vs whom he hath called, not of the Iewes only, but alſo of the Gentiles.

      * VERSE 25.As he ſaith alſo in
Oſee,Oſe. 2.23I will call them My people, which were not my people,1. Pet. 2.10.and her Beloued, which was not beloued.26.And it ſhall come to paſſe, that in the place where it was ſaid vnto them,Oſe. 1.10Yee are not my people, there they ſhall be called the children of the liuing GOD.

      * VERSE 27.Eſay 10.22.23Eſay alſo cryeth concerning Iſrael, Though the Number of the children of Iſrael bee as the ſand of the Sea, a Remnant ſhall be ſaued.28.For he will finiſh theOr account.worke, and cut it ſhort in righteouſneſſe, becauſe a ſhort worke will the Lord make vpon the earth.29.And as Eſaias ſaid before,Eſay 1.9.Except the Lord of Sabbath had left vs a ſeede, we had beene as Sodoma, and beene made like vnto Gomorrah.

      * VERSE 30.What ſhall wee ſay then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after Righteouſneſſe, haue attained to Righteouſnes, euen the Righteouſneſſe which is of faith.31.But Iſrael which followed after the law of Righteouſneſſe, hath not attained to the law of Righteouſneſſe.32.Wherefore? becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the workes of the law.

      * VERSE 32.For they ſtumbled at the ſtumbling ſtone,33.As it is written,Eſay 8.14. &
18.16. 1 Pet. 2.6.Behold, I lay in Sion a ſtumbling ſtone, and Rocke of offence, and whoſoeuer beleeueth on him, ſhall not beOr, confounded.aſhamed.

      * VERSE 1.Brethren, my hearts deſire and prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they might be ſaued.

      * VERSE 2.For I beare them record, that they haue a zeale of God, but not according to knowledge.

      * VERSE 2.For they being ignorant of Gods righteouſnes, and going about to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe, haue not ſubmitted themſelues to the righteouſnes of God.

      * VERSE 4.For Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to euery one that beleeueth.

      * VERSE 5.For Moſes deſcribeth the righteouſneſſe which is of the Lawe, thatLeuit. 18.5. Ezech.
20.11. Gal. 3.12.the man which doth thoſe things ſhall liue by them.6.But the righteouſneſſe which is of faith, ſpeaketh on this wiſe;Deut. 30.12.Say not in thy heart, Who ſhall aſcend into Heauen? That is, to bring Chriſt downe from aboue.7.Or, Who ſhall deſcend into the Deepe? that is to bring vp Christ againe from the dead.8.But what ſayth it?Deut. 30.14.The Word is nigh thee, euen in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that is the Word of faith which we preach.

      * VERSE 9.That if thou ſhalt confeſſe with thy mouth the Lord Ieſus, and ſhalt beleeue in thy heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaued.10.For with the heart man beleeueth vnto righteouſneſſe, and with the mouth confeſsion is made vnto ſaluation.

      * VERSE 11.For the Scripture ſaith,Eſay 28.16.Whoſoeuer belieueth on him, ſhall not be aſhamed.

      * VERSE 12.For there is no difference betweene the Iew and the Greeke: for the ſame Lord ouer all, is rich vnto all that call vpon him.

      * VERSE 13.Ioel. 2.32. Act.
2.21.For whoſoeuer ſhall call on the Name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaued.

      * VERSE 14.How then ſhall they call on him, in whom they haue not belieued? and how ſhall they belieue in him of whom they haue not heard? and how ſhall they heare without a Preacher?15.And how ſhall they preach except they be ſent? as it is written,Eſay 52.7. Naum.
1.15.How beautifull are the feet of them, that preach the Goſpel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things?16.But they haue not all obeyed the Goſpel: For Eſayas ſaith,Eſay 53.1. Iohn
12.38.Lord, who hath belieued ourOr Preaching. Gr. the hearing of vs.report?17.So then, Faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.

      * VERSE 15.As it is written, How beautifull are the feete of thoſe which preach the Goſpell of Peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!

      * VERSE 16.But they haue not all obeyed the Goſpell, for Eſayas ſaith, Lord, who hath belieued our report?

      * VERSE 18.But I ſay, Haue they not heard? Yes verily,Pſal. 19.4.their ſound went into all the earth, and their words vnto the ends of the world.

      * VERSE 19.But I ſay, did not Iſrael know? Firſt, Moſes ſaith,Deut. 32.31.I will prouoke you to iealouſie by them that are no people, and by a fooliſh Nation I will anger you.

      * VERSE 20.But Eſayas is very bold, and ſaith;Eſay. 65.1.I was found of them that ſought me not: I was made manifeſt vnto them that asked not after me.

      * VERSE 21.But to Iſrael hee ſaith,Eſay. 65.2.All day long I haue ſtretched out my hands to a diſobedient and gaineſaying people.

      * VERS. 1.I ſay then, Hath God caſt away his people? God forbid. For I alſo am an Iſraelite, of the ſeed of Abraham, of the tribe of Beniamin.

      * VERSE 2.For I alſo am an Iſraelite, of the ſeed of Abraham, of the tribe of Beniamin.

      * VERS. 2.God hath not caſt away his people which he foreknew.

      * VERSE 2.Wote you not what the ſcripture ſaith of Elias? How be maketh intercesſion to GOD againſt
Iſrael, ſaying.3Lord they haue killed thy prophets, and digged downe thine Alters, and I am left alone, and they ſeeke my life.4But what ſayth the anſwere of God vnto him. I haue reſerued to my ſelfe 7000 men who haue not bowed the knee to the Image of Baal.

      * VERSE. 2.How he makes interceſsion to God againſt Iſraell ſaying.

      * VERSE 3.Lord they haue killed thy Prophets, and digged downe thine Altars; and I am left alone, and they ſeeke my life.

      * VERSE. 4.But what ſayth the anſwere of God vnto him? I haue reſerued to my ſelfe 7000 men who haue not bowed the knee to the Image of Baal.

      * VERSE. 4.I haue reſerued to my ſelfe
7000 men who haue not bowed the knee to the Image of Baal.

      * VERSE 5.Euen ſo at this preſent time alſo there is a remnant, according to the election of Grace.

      * VERSE. 6.And if by Grace, then is it no more of workes, otherwiſe Grace were no more Grace? But if it be of workes, then is it no more grace, otherwiſe worke is no more worke.

      * VERSE. 7.What then? Iſrael hath not obtained that which he ſeeketh for, but the election hath obtained it, and the reſt were blinded.Or hardned.

      * VERSE 8.According as it is written,Eſay 29.10.God hath giuen them the ſpirit of ſlumber,or remorſe.eyes that they ſhould not ſee,Eſay. 6.9.& eares that they ſhould not heare vnto this day.

      * VERSE 9.And Dauid ſaithPſal. 69.22.Let their table be made a ſnare, and a trap, and a ſtumbling blocke, and a recompence vnto them.10.Pſal. 69.23.Let their eyes be darkned that they may not ſee, and bow downe their backe alway.

      * VERSE 11.I ſay then; Haue they ſtumbled that they ſhould fall? God forbid, but rather through their fall ſaluation is come to the Gentiles, to prouke them to Idolatry.

      * VERSE 12.Now if the fall of them be the Riches of the world, and the diminiſhing of them,Or decay, or loſſe.the riches of the Gentiles: How much more their fulneſſe?

      * VERSE. 13.For I ſpeake to you Gentiles, in as much as I am the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, I magnifie mine office.14.If by any meanes I may prouoke to emulation, them which are my fleſh, and might ſaue ſome of them.

      * VERSE 15.For if the caſting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what ſhall the receiuing of them be, but life from the dead?

      * VERSE 16.For if the firſt fruite be holy, the lumpe is alſo holy: and if the roote be holy, ſo are the branches.

      * VERSE. 17.And if ſome of the branches be broken off, and thou being a wild oliue tree, wert graffed in a mongſt them. And with them partakeſt of the root and fatnes of the oliue tree.18.Boaſt not thy ſelfe againſt the branches: but if thou boaſt thou beareſt not the root, but the root thee.

      * VERSE. 19.Thou wilt ſay then, the branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.20Well, becauſe of vnbeleefe they were broken off, and thou ſtandeſt by faith: Bee not high minded, but feare.

      * VERSE. 20.—Be not high minded but feare.

      * VERSE 20.—But feare.

      * VERSE 21.For if God ſpared not the naturall branches, take heed leſt he alſo ſpare not thee.

      * VERSE. 22.Behold therefore the goodnes and ſeuerity of God; on them which fell, ſeuerity: but towards thee, goodneſſe, if thou continue in his goodneſſe: otherwiſe thou alſo ſhalt be cut off.

      * VERSE. 23.And they alſo if they bide not ſtill in vnbeleefe, ſhall be graffed in, for God is able to graffe them in againe.

      * VERSE. 24.For if thou wert cut out of the Oliue tree, which is wilde by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good Oliue tree: how much more ſhal theſe which be the Naturall branches bee graffed, into their tree?

      * VERSE 25.For I would not brethren that ye ſhould be ignorant of this mystery, left you ſhould be wiſe in your owne conceits, that blindneſſeor hardneſſe.in part is hapned to Iſrael, vntill the fulneſſe of the Gentiles be come in.26.And ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaued.

      * VERSE. 26.As it is written,Eſay. 59 20.then ſhall come out of Syon the deliuerer, and ſhall turne away vngodlines from
Iacob.27For this is my couenant vnto them, when I ſhall take away their ſinnes.

      * VERSE 28.As concerning the Goſpell, they are enemies for your ſake: but as touching the election, they are beloued for the fathers ſakes.

      * VERSE 29.For the gifts and calling of God, are without repentance.

      * VERSE. 30.For as yee in times paſt, haue not beleeuedOr obeyed.God, yet haue now obtained mercy through their vnbeleefe.31.Euen ſo haue theſe alſo now not beleeued,Or obeyed.that through your mercie, they alſo may obtaine mercie.

      * VERSE 31.Euen ſo haue theſe alſo now not beleeued,Or obeyed.that through your mercie they alſo might obtaine mercie.

      * VERSE. 32.For God hath concluded them all in vnbeleefe,Or ſhutte them all vp together.that he might haue mercie on all.

      * VERSE 32.—That he might haue mercie on all.

      * VERSE 33.O the depth of the riches, both of the wiſdome and knowledge of God! How vnſearchable are his iudgments, and his wayes paſt finding out!34.Eſay 40.13. Wiſd. 9.13. 1. Cor.
2.16.For who hath knowne the mind of the Lord, or who hath beene his counſeller?35.Or who hath firſt giuen him, and it ſhall be recompenſed him againe?

      * VERSE 36.For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.

    _ THE TENTH CHAPTER OF THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANES.

      * VERSE. 1.There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Ieſus, who walke not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.

      * VERSE 2.For the Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Ieſus, hath made me free from the Law of Sinne, and Death.

      * VERSE 3.For what the Law could not doe, in that it was weake through the fleſh; GOD ſending his owne Son in the likenes of ſinfull fleſh, and for ſin;Or, by a ſacrifice for ſin.condemned ſinne in the Fleſh:4.That the righteouſneſſe of the Law might bee fulfilled in vs, who walke not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.

      * VERSE 4.That the Righteouſneſſe of the Law might be fulfilled in vs, which walke not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.

      * VERSE 5.For they that are after the fleſh, doe mind the things of the fleſh, but they that are after the ſpirit, the things of the ſpirit.6.For toOr, the minding of the fleſh.be carnally minded is death, but toor, the minding of the ſpirit.bee ſpiritually minded is life and peace.7.Becauſeor, the minding of the fleſh.the carnall mind is enmity againſt God: for it is not ſubiect to the Law of GOD, neither indeed can bee.

      * VERSE. 6.For to be Carnally minded is Death: but to be Spiritually minded is life and peace.

      * VERSE 7.Becauſe the Carnall minde is Enmitie againſt God: for it is not ſubiect to the Law of God, nor indeed can be.

      * VERSE 8.So then they that are in the Fleſh, cannot pleaſe GOD.

      * VERSE 9.But yee are not in the fleſh, but in the spirit, if ſo bee that the ſpirit of God dwelleth in you, &c.And ſo to the end of the 11. verſe.

      * VERSE 10.And if Chriſt be in you, the bodie is dead becauſe of ſinne, but the ſpirit is life for righteouſneſſe ſake.

      * VERSE 11.But if the Spirit of him, which raiſed vp Ieſus from the Dead, dwell in you; he that raiſed vp Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortall bodiesOr, becauſe of his Spirit.by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.

      * VERSE. 12.Therefore, brethren, we are debters, not to the Fleſh, to liue after the Fleſh.Verſe 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

      * VERSE 13.For if yee liue after the Fleſh, ye ſhall dye: but if ye through the Spirit doe mortifie the deeds of the body, yee ſhall liue.

      * VERSE 14.For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the ſonnes of God.

      * VERSE 15.For yee haue not receiued the ſpirit of bondage againe to feare; but yee haue receiued the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father.

      * VERSE 16.The Spirit it ſelfe beareth witneſſe with our ſpirit, that we are the Children of God.

      * VERSE 17.And if Children, then Heyres: Heyres of God, and Ioynt-heyres with Chriſt. If ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified together.

      * VERSE 18.For I reckon that the ſuffrings of this preſent time, are not worthy of the glorie to be reuealed in vs.

      * VERSE 19.For the earneſt expectation of the Creature, waiteth for the manifeſtation of the Sonnes of God.20.For the creature was made ſubiect to vanitie, not willingly, but by reaſon of him who hath ſubiected the ſame in hope.21.Becauſe the Creature it ſelfe alſo ſhall bee deliuered from the bondage of Corruption, into the glorious libertie of the Children of God.22.For we know thatOr euery Creature.the whole Creation groneth, and trauelleth in paine together, vntill now.23.And not onely they, but our ſelues alſo, which haue the firſt fruits of the Spirit, euen we our ſelues grone within our ſelues, waiting for the Adoption, to wit, the Redemption of our Body.

      * VERSE 21.Becauſe the Creature it ſelfe alſo, &c.

      * VERSE 23.And not onely they, but our ſelues alſo which haue the firſt fruits of the Spirit. Euen wee our ſelues, groane within our ſelues, waiting for the Adoption, to wit, theLuc. 21.28.Redemption of our body.

      * VERSE 24.For we are ſaued by Hope: but Hope that is ſeene is not Hope: for what a man ſeeth, why doth hee yet hope for?25.But if we hope for that we ſee not, then doe wee with Patience wait for it.

      * VERE 26.Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our Infirmities: for we know not what wee ſhould pray for as we ought: but the Spirit it ſelfe maketh interceſsion for vs with gronings which cannot be vttered.

      * Verſe 26.For wee know not what wee ſhould pray for as we ought: but the Spirit it ſelfe maketh interceſſion for vs with gronings which cannot be vttered.

      * VERSE 27.And he that ſearcheth the hearts, knoweth what is in the mind of the Spirit,Or, that.becauſe he maketh interceſſion for the Saints according to the will of God.

      * VERSE 28.And wee know that all things worke together for good to them that loue God, to them who are called according to his purpoſe.

      * VERSE 29.For whom he did fore-know, he alſo did predeſtinate, to be conformed to the Image of his Sonne, that hee might be the firſt-borne among many Brethren.

      * VERSE 30.Moreouer whom hee did predeſtinate, them hee alſo called, and whom he called, them hee alſo iuſtified: and whom he iuſtified, them he alſo glorified.

      * VERSE 31.What ſhall we then ſay to theſe things? If God be for vs? Who can be againſt vs?32.He that ſpared not, &c.to the end of the Chapter.

      * VERSE 32.Hee that ſpared not his owne Sonne, but deliuered him vp for vs: how ſhall hee not with him alſo freely giue vs all things?

      * VERSE 33.Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that Iuſtifieth.

      * VERSE 34.Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that dyed, yea rather that is riſen againe, who is euen at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh Interceſſion for vs.

      * VERSE 35.Who ſhall ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt? ſhall tribulation, or diſtreſſe, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſſe, or perill, or ſword?

      * VERSE 36.As it is written,Pſal 44.22.For thy ſake, are wee killed all the day long, wee are accounted as ſheepe for the ſlaughter.

      * VERSE 37.Nay, in all theſe things wee are more then Conquerors, through him that loued vs.

      * VERSE 38.For I am perſwaded, that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come,39.Nor height, nor depth, nor any other Creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate vs from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.

      * VERSE 1.I ſay the truth in Chriſt, I lye not, my conſcience alſo bearing me witneſſe in the holy Ghoſt.2.That I haue great heauineſſe and continuall ſorrow in my heart.

      * VERSE 1.I ſay the Truth in Chriſt, I lye not, my Conſcience alſo bearing me witneſſe in the holy Ghoſt.

      * VERSE 6.Not as though the Word of God hath taken none effect, &c.

      * VERSE 7.Neither becauſe they are the ſeede of Abraham, are they all children:Gen. 21.12.but in
Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called.8.That is, they which are the Children of the fleſh, theſe are not the children of God: but the children of the Promiſe are counted for the ſeede.9.Gen. 18.10.For this is the word of Promiſe; At this time will I come, and Sara ſhall haue a ſonne.

      * VERSE 10.And not onely this, but when
Rebecca alſo had conceiued by one, euen by our Father
Iſaac,11.(For the children beeing not yet borne, neither hauing done any good or euill, that the purpoſe of God, according to Election, might ſtand, not of works, but of him that calleth)12.It was ſaid vnto her,Gen. 25.23.Or Greater.The Elder ſhall ſerue theOr Younger.Younger;13.As it is written,Mal. 1.2.Iacob haue I loued, but Eſau haue I hated.

      * VERSE 11.(For the children being not yet borne, neither hauing done any good or euill, that the purpoſe of God according to election might ſtand, not of workes, but of him that calleth.)

      * VERSE 14.What ſhal we ſay then? Is there vnrighteouſneſſe with God? God forbid.15.For he ſaith to
MoſesExod. 33.19.:
I will haue mercy, on whom I will haue mercy, and I will haue compaſſion, on whom I will haue compaſſion.16.So then, it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.

      * VERSE 17.For the Scripture ſaith vnto
Pharaoh:Exod. 9.16.Euen for this ſame purpoſe haue I raiſed thee vp: that I might ſhew my power in thee, and that my Name might be declared throughout all the earth.

      * VERSE 18.Therefore he hath mercy, on whom he will haue mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.

      * VERSE 22.What if God, willing to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power knowne, indured with long ſuffering the veſſels of wrathOr made vp.fitted to destruction,23.And that hee might make knowne the riches of his glory, on the veſſels of glory, which hee had afore prepared vnto glory?

      * VERSE 22.Indured with long-ſuffering the veſſels of Wrath.

      * VERSE 22.To ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known.

      * VERSE 23.And that hee might make knowne the riches of his glory, on the veſſels of mercy.

      * VERSE 24.Euen vs whom he hath called, not of the Iewes only, but alſo of the Gentiles.

      * VERSE 25.As he ſaith alſo in
Oſee,Oſe. 2.23I will call them My people, which were not my people,1. Pet. 2.10.and her Beloued, which was not beloued.26.And it ſhall come to paſſe, that in the place where it was ſaid vnto them,Oſe. 1.10Yee are not my people, there they ſhall be called the children of the liuing GOD.

      * VERSE 27.Eſay 10.22.23Eſay alſo cryeth concerning Iſrael, Though the Number of the children of Iſrael bee as the ſand of the Sea, a Remnant ſhall be ſaued.28.For he will finiſh theOr account.worke, and cut it ſhort in righteouſneſſe, becauſe a ſhort worke will the Lord make vpon the earth.29.And as Eſaias ſaid before,Eſay 1.9.Except the Lord of Sabbath had left vs a ſeede, we had beene as Sodoma, and beene made like vnto Gomorrah.

      * VERSE 30.What ſhall wee ſay then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after Righteouſneſſe, haue attained to Righteouſnes, euen the Righteouſneſſe which is of faith.31.But Iſrael which followed after the law of Righteouſneſſe, hath not attained to the law of Righteouſneſſe.32.Wherefore? becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the workes of the law.

      * VERSE 32.For they ſtumbled at the ſtumbling ſtone,33.As it is written,Eſay 8.14. &
18.16. 1 Pet. 2.6.Behold, I lay in Sion a ſtumbling ſtone, and Rocke of offence, and whoſoeuer beleeueth on him, ſhall not beOr, confounded.aſhamed.

      * VERSE 1.Brethren, my hearts deſire and prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they might be ſaued.

      * VERSE 2.For I beare them record, that they haue a zeale of God, but not according to knowledge.

      * VERSE 2.For they being ignorant of Gods righteouſnes, and going about to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe, haue not ſubmitted themſelues to the righteouſnes of God.

      * VERSE 4.For Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to euery one that beleeueth.

That is, to bring Chriſt downe from aboue.7.Or, Who ſhall deſcend into the Deepe? that is to bring vp Christ againe from the dead.8.But what ſayth it?Deut. 30.14.The Word is nigh thee, euen in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that is the Word of faith which we preach.

      * VERSE 9.That if thou ſhalt confeſſe with thy mouth the Lord Ieſus, and ſhalt beleeue in thy heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaued.10.For with the heart man beleeueth vnto righteouſneſſe, and with the mouth confeſsion is made vnto ſaluation.

      * VERSE 11.For the Scripture ſaith,Eſay 28.16.Whoſoeuer belieueth on him, ſhall not be aſhamed.

      * VERSE 12.For there is no difference betweene the Iew and the Greeke: for the ſame Lord ouer all, is rich vnto all that call vpon him.

      * VERSE 13.Ioel. 2.32. Act.
2.21.For whoſoeuer ſhall call on the Name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaued.

      * VERSE 14.How then ſhall they call on him, in whom they haue not belieued? and how ſhall they belieue in him of whom they haue not heard? and how ſhall they heare without a Preacher?15.And how ſhall they preach except they be ſent? as it is written,Eſay 52.7. Naum.
1.15.How beautifull are the feet of them, that preach the Goſpel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things?16.But they haue not all obeyed the Goſpel: For Eſayas ſaith,Eſay 53.1. Iohn
12.38.Lord, who hath belieued ourOr Preaching. Gr. the hearing of vs.report?17.So then, Faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.

      * VERSE 15.As it is written, How beautifull are the feete of thoſe which preach the Goſpell of Peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!

      * VERSE 16.But they haue not all obeyed the Goſpell, for Eſayas ſaith, Lord, who hath belieued our report?

      * VERSE 18.But I ſay, Haue they not heard? Yes verily,Pſal. 19.4.their ſound went into all the earth, and their words vnto the ends of the world.

      * VERSE 19.But I ſay, did not Iſrael know? Firſt, Moſes ſaith,Deut. 32.31.I will prouoke you to iealouſie by them that are no people, and by a fooliſh Nation I will anger you.

      * VERSE 20.But Eſayas is very bold, and ſaith;Eſay. 65.1.I was found of them that ſought me not: I was made manifeſt vnto them that asked not after me.

      * VERSE 21.But to Iſrael hee ſaith,Eſay. 65.2.All day long I haue ſtretched out my hands to a diſobedient and gaineſaying people.

      * VERS. 1.I ſay then, Hath God caſt away his people? God forbid. For I alſo am an Iſraelite, of the ſeed of Abraham, of the tribe of Beniamin.

      * VERSE 2.For I alſo am an Iſraelite, of the ſeed of Abraham, of the tribe of Beniamin.

      * VERS. 2.God hath not caſt away his people which he foreknew.

      * VERSE 2.Wote you not what the ſcripture ſaith of Elias? How be maketh intercesſion to GOD againſt
Iſrael, ſaying.3Lord they haue killed thy prophets, and digged downe thine Alters, and I am left alone, and they ſeeke my life.4But what ſayth the anſwere of God vnto him. I haue reſerued to my ſelfe 7000 men who haue not bowed the knee to the Image of Baal.

      * VERSE. 2.How he makes interceſsion to God againſt Iſraell ſaying.

      * VERSE 3.Lord they haue killed thy Prophets, and digged downe thine Altars; and I am left alone, and they ſeeke my life.

      * VERSE. 4.But what ſayth the anſwere of God vnto him? I haue reſerued to my ſelfe 7000 men who haue not bowed the knee to the Image of Baal.

      * VERSE. 4.I haue reſerued to my ſelfe
7000 men who haue not bowed the knee to the Image of Baal.

      * VERSE 5.Euen ſo at this preſent time alſo there is a remnant, according to the election of Grace.

      * VERSE. 6.And if by Grace, then is it no more of workes, otherwiſe Grace were no more Grace? But if it be of workes, then is it no more grace, otherwiſe worke is no more worke.

      * VERSE. 7.What then? Iſrael hath not obtained that which he ſeeketh for, but the election hath obtained it, and the reſt were blinded.Or hardned.

      * VERSE 8.According as it is written,Eſay 29.10.God hath giuen them the ſpirit of ſlumber,or remorſe.eyes that they ſhould not ſee,Eſay. 6.9.& eares that they ſhould not heare vnto this day.

      * VERSE 9.And Dauid ſaithPſal. 69.22.Let their table be made a ſnare, and a trap, and a ſtumbling blocke, and a recompence vnto them.10.Pſal. 69.23.Let their eyes be darkned that they may not ſee, and bow downe their backe alway.

      * VERSE 11.I ſay then; Haue they ſtumbled that they ſhould fall? God forbid, but rather through their fall ſaluation is come to the Gentiles, to prouke them to Idolatry.

      * VERSE 12.Now if the fall of them be the Riches of the world, and the diminiſhing of them,Or decay, or loſſe.the riches of the Gentiles: How much more their fulneſſe?

      * VERSE. 13.For I ſpeake to you Gentiles, in as much as I am the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, I magnifie mine office.14.If by any meanes I may prouoke to emulation, them which are my fleſh, and might ſaue ſome of them.

      * VERSE 15.For if the caſting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what ſhall the receiuing of them be, but life from the dead?

      * VERSE 16.For if the firſt fruite be holy, the lumpe is alſo holy: and if the roote be holy, ſo are the branches.

      * VERSE. 17.And if ſome of the branches be broken off, and thou being a wild oliue tree, wert graffed in a mongſt them. And with them partakeſt of the root and fatnes of the oliue tree.18.Boaſt not thy ſelfe againſt the branches: but if thou boaſt thou beareſt not the root, but the root thee.

      * VERSE. 19.Thou wilt ſay then, the branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.20Well, becauſe of vnbeleefe they were broken off, and thou ſtandeſt by faith: Bee not high minded, but feare.

      * VERSE. 20.—Be not high minded but feare.

      * VERSE 20.—But feare.

      * VERSE 21.For if God ſpared not the naturall branches, take heed leſt he alſo ſpare not thee.

      * VERSE. 22.Behold therefore the goodnes and ſeuerity of God; on them which fell, ſeuerity: but towards thee, goodneſſe, if thou continue in his goodneſſe: otherwiſe thou alſo ſhalt be cut off.

      * VERSE. 23.And they alſo if they bide not ſtill in vnbeleefe, ſhall be graffed in, for God is able to graffe them in againe.

      * VERSE. 24.For if thou wert cut out of the Oliue tree, which is wilde by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good Oliue tree: how much more ſhal theſe which be the Naturall branches bee graffed, into their tree?

      * VERSE 25.For I would not brethren that ye ſhould be ignorant of this mystery, left you ſhould be wiſe in your owne conceits, that blindneſſeor hardneſſe.in part is hapned to Iſrael, vntill the fulneſſe of the Gentiles be come in.26.And ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaued.

      * VERSE. 26.As it is written,Eſay. 59 20.then ſhall come out of Syon the deliuerer, and ſhall turne away vngodlines from
Iacob.27For this is my couenant vnto them, when I ſhall take away their ſinnes.

      * VERSE 28.As concerning the Goſpell, they are enemies for your ſake: but as touching the election, they are beloued for the fathers ſakes.

      * VERSE 29.For the gifts and calling of God, are without repentance.

      * VERSE. 30.For as yee in times paſt, haue not beleeuedOr obeyed.God, yet haue now obtained mercy through their vnbeleefe.31.Euen ſo haue theſe alſo now not beleeued,Or obeyed.that through your mercie, they alſo may obtaine mercie.

      * VERSE 31.Euen ſo haue theſe alſo now not beleeued,Or obeyed.that through your mercie they alſo might obtaine mercie.

      * VERSE. 32.For God hath concluded them all in vnbeleefe,Or ſhutte them all vp together.that he might haue mercie on all.

      * VERSE 32.—That he might haue mercie on all.

      * VERSE 33.O the depth of the riches, both of the wiſdome and knowledge of God! How vnſearchable are his iudgments, and his wayes paſt finding out!34.Eſay 40.13. Wiſd. 9.13. 1. Cor.
2.16.For who hath knowne the mind of the Lord, or who hath beene his counſeller?35.Or who hath firſt giuen him, and it ſhall be recompenſed him againe?

    _ CHAP. XI.

      * VERSE. 1.There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Ieſus, who walke not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.

      * VERSE 2.For the Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Ieſus, hath made me free from the Law of Sinne, and Death.

      * VERSE 3.For what the Law could not doe, in that it was weake through the fleſh; GOD ſending his owne Son in the likenes of ſinfull fleſh, and for ſin;Or, by a ſacrifice for ſin.condemned ſinne in the Fleſh:4.That the righteouſneſſe of the Law might bee fulfilled in vs, who walke not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.

      * VERSE 4.That the Righteouſneſſe of the Law might be fulfilled in vs, which walke not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.

      * VERSE 5.For they that are after the fleſh, doe mind the things of the fleſh, but they that are after the ſpirit, the things of the ſpirit.6.For toOr, the minding of the fleſh.be carnally minded is death, but toor, the minding of the ſpirit.bee ſpiritually minded is life and peace.7.Becauſeor, the minding of the fleſh.the carnall mind is enmity againſt God: for it is not ſubiect to the Law of GOD, neither indeed can bee.

      * VERSE. 6.For to be Carnally minded is Death: but to be Spiritually minded is life and peace.

      * VERSE 7.Becauſe the Carnall minde is Enmitie againſt God: for it is not ſubiect to the Law of God, nor indeed can be.

      * VERSE 8.So then they that are in the Fleſh, cannot pleaſe GOD.

      * VERSE 9.But yee are not in the fleſh, but in the spirit, if ſo bee that the ſpirit of God dwelleth in you, &c.And ſo to the end of the 11. verſe.

      * VERSE 10.And if Chriſt be in you, the bodie is dead becauſe of ſinne, but the ſpirit is life for righteouſneſſe ſake.

      * VERSE 11.But if the Spirit of him, which raiſed vp Ieſus from the Dead, dwell in you; he that raiſed vp Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortall bodiesOr, becauſe of his Spirit.by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.

      * VERSE. 12.Therefore, brethren, we are debters, not to the Fleſh, to liue after the Fleſh.Verſe 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

      * VERSE 13.For if yee liue after the Fleſh, ye ſhall dye: but if ye through the Spirit doe mortifie the deeds of the body, yee ſhall liue.

      * VERSE 14.For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the ſonnes of God.

      * VERSE 15.For yee haue not receiued the ſpirit of bondage againe to feare; but yee haue receiued the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father.

      * VERSE 16.The Spirit it ſelfe beareth witneſſe with our ſpirit, that we are the Children of God.

      * VERSE 17.And if Children, then Heyres: Heyres of God, and Ioynt-heyres with Chriſt. If ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified together.

      * VERSE 18.For I reckon that the ſuffrings of this preſent time, are not worthy of the glorie to be reuealed in vs.

      * VERSE 19.For the earneſt expectation of the Creature, waiteth for the manifeſtation of the Sonnes of God.20.For the creature was made ſubiect to vanitie, not willingly, but by reaſon of him who hath ſubiected the ſame in hope.21.Becauſe the Creature it ſelfe alſo ſhall bee deliuered from the bondage of Corruption, into the glorious libertie of the Children of God.22.For we know thatOr euery Creature.the whole Creation groneth, and trauelleth in paine together, vntill now.23.And not onely they, but our ſelues alſo, which haue the firſt fruits of the Spirit, euen we our ſelues grone within our ſelues, waiting for the Adoption, to wit, the Redemption of our Body.

      * VERSE 21.Becauſe the Creature it ſelfe alſo, &c.

      * VERSE 23.And not onely they, but our ſelues alſo which haue the firſt fruits of the Spirit. Euen wee our ſelues, groane within our ſelues, waiting for the Adoption, to wit, theLuc. 21.28.Redemption of our body.

      * VERSE 24.For we are ſaued by Hope: but Hope that is ſeene is not Hope: for what a man ſeeth, why doth hee yet hope for?25.But if we hope for that we ſee not, then doe wee with Patience wait for it.

      * VERE 26.Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our Infirmities: for we know not what wee ſhould pray for as we ought: but the Spirit it ſelfe maketh interceſsion for vs with gronings which cannot be vttered.

      * Verſe 26.For wee know not what wee ſhould pray for as we ought: but the Spirit it ſelfe maketh interceſſion for vs with gronings which cannot be vttered.

      * VERSE 27.And he that ſearcheth the hearts, knoweth what is in the mind of the Spirit,Or, that.becauſe he maketh interceſſion for the Saints according to the will of God.

      * VERSE 28.And wee know that all things worke together for good to them that loue God, to them who are called according to his purpoſe.

      * VERSE 29.For whom he did fore-know, he alſo did predeſtinate, to be conformed to the Image of his Sonne, that hee might be the firſt-borne among many Brethren.

      * VERSE 30.Moreouer whom hee did predeſtinate, them hee alſo called, and whom he called, them hee alſo iuſtified: and whom he iuſtified, them he alſo glorified.

      * VERSE 31.What ſhall we then ſay to theſe things? If God be for vs? Who can be againſt vs?32.He that ſpared not, &c.to the end of the Chapter.

      * VERSE 32.Hee that ſpared not his owne Sonne, but deliuered him vp for vs: how ſhall hee not with him alſo freely giue vs all things?

      * VERSE 33.Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that Iuſtifieth.

      * VERSE 34.Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that dyed, yea rather that is riſen againe, who is euen at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh Interceſſion for vs.

      * VERSE 35.Who ſhall ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt? ſhall tribulation, or diſtreſſe, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſſe, or perill, or ſword?

      * VERSE 36.As it is written,Pſal 44.22.For thy ſake, are wee killed all the day long, wee are accounted as ſheepe for the ſlaughter.

      * VERSE 37.Nay, in all theſe things wee are more then Conquerors, through him that loued vs.

      * VERSE 38.For I am perſwaded, that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come,39.Nor height, nor depth, nor any other Creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate vs from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.

      * VERSE 1.I ſay the truth in Chriſt, I lye not, my conſcience alſo bearing me witneſſe in the holy Ghoſt.2.That I haue great heauineſſe and continuall ſorrow in my heart.

      * VERSE 2.That I haue great heauineſſe, and continuall ſorrow in my heart.

      * VERSE 1.I ſay the Truth in Chriſt, I lye not, my Conſcience alſo bearing me witneſſe in the holy Ghoſt.

      * VERSE 3.For I could wiſh that may ſelfe wereOr ſeparated.accurſed from Chriſt, for my brethren, my kinſmen according to the Fleſh.

      * VERSE 4.Who are Iſraelites: to whome pertaineth the Adoption, and the Glorie, and theOr Teſtaments.Couenants, and the giuing of the Law, and the ſeruice of God, and the promiſes.5.Whoſe are the Fathers, and of whome as concerning the Fleſh, Christ came, who is ouer all, God bleſſed for euer, Amen.

      * VERSE 6.Not as though the Word of God hath taken none effect, &c.

      * VERSE 7.Neither becauſe they are the ſeede of Abraham, are they all children:Gen. 21.12.but in
Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called.8.That is, they which are the Children of the fleſh, theſe are not the children of God: but the children of the Promiſe are counted for the ſeede.9.Gen. 18.10.For this is the word of Promiſe; At this time will I come, and Sara ſhall haue a ſonne.

      * VERSE 10.And not onely this, but when
Rebecca alſo had conceiued by one, euen by our Father
Iſaac,11.(For the children beeing not yet borne, neither hauing done any good or euill, that the purpoſe of God, according to Election, might ſtand, not of works, but of him that calleth)12.It was ſaid vnto her,Gen. 25.23.Or Greater.The Elder ſhall ſerue theOr Younger.Younger;13.As it is written,Mal. 1.2.Iacob haue I loued, but Eſau haue I hated.

      * VERSE 11.(For the children being not yet borne, neither hauing done any good or euill, that the purpoſe of God according to election might ſtand, not of workes, but of him that calleth.)

      * VERSE 14.What ſhal we ſay then? Is there vnrighteouſneſſe with God? God forbid.15.For he ſaith to
MoſesExod. 33.19.:
I will haue mercy, on whom I will haue mercy, and I will haue compaſſion, on whom I will haue compaſſion.16.So then, it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.

      * VERSE 17.For the Scripture ſaith vnto
Pharaoh:Exod. 9.16.Euen for this ſame purpoſe haue I raiſed thee vp: that I might ſhew my power in thee, and that my Name might be declared throughout all the earth.

      * VERSE 18.Therefore he hath mercy, on whom he will haue mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.

      * VERSE 19.Thou ſhalt ſay vnto me, Why doth he yet finde fault? for who hath reſiſted his will?and ſo to the end of the 23. verſe.

      * VERSE 20.Nay, but O man, who art thou thatOr anſwereſt againe, or diſputeſt with God.replyeſt againſt God? Shall the thing formed, ſay to him that formed itEſay 45.9., Why haſt thou made me thus?21.Hath not the PotterIer. 8.6. Wiſd.
15.7.power ouer the Clay, of the ſame lumpe to make one veſſell vnto honour, and another vnto diſhonour.

      * VERSE 22.What if God, willing to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power knowne, indured with long ſuffering the veſſels of wrathOr made vp.fitted to destruction,23.And that hee might make knowne the riches of his glory, on the veſſels of glory, which hee had afore prepared vnto glory?

      * VERSE 22.Indured with long-ſuffering the veſſels of Wrath.

      * VERSE 22.To ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known.

      * VERSE 23.And that hee might make knowne the riches of his glory, on the veſſels of mercy.

      * VERSE 24.Euen vs whom he hath called, not of the Iewes only, but alſo of the Gentiles.

      * VERSE 25.As he ſaith alſo in
Oſee,Oſe. 2.23I will call them My people, which were not my people,1. Pet. 2.10.and her Beloued, which was not beloued.26.And it ſhall come to paſſe, that in the place where it was ſaid vnto them,Oſe. 1.10Yee are not my people, there they ſhall be called the children of the liuing GOD.

      * VERSE 27.Eſay 10.22.23Eſay alſo cryeth concerning Iſrael, Though the Number of the children of Iſrael bee as the ſand of the Sea, a Remnant ſhall be ſaued.28.For he will finiſh theOr account.worke, and cut it ſhort in righteouſneſſe, becauſe a ſhort worke will the Lord make vpon the earth.29.And as Eſaias ſaid before,Eſay 1.9.Except the Lord of Sabbath had left vs a ſeede, we had beene as Sodoma, and beene made like vnto Gomorrah.

      * VERSE 30.What ſhall wee ſay then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after Righteouſneſſe, haue attained to Righteouſnes, euen the Righteouſneſſe which is of faith.31.But Iſrael which followed after the law of Righteouſneſſe, hath not attained to the law of Righteouſneſſe.32.Wherefore? becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the workes of the law.

      * VERSE 32.For they ſtumbled at the ſtumbling ſtone,33.As it is written,Eſay 8.14. &
18.16. 1 Pet. 2.6.Behold, I lay in Sion a ſtumbling ſtone, and Rocke of offence, and whoſoeuer beleeueth on him, ſhall not beOr, confounded.aſhamed.

      * VERSE 1.Brethren, my hearts deſire and prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they might be ſaued.

      * VERSE 2.For I beare them record, that they haue a zeale of God, but not according to knowledge.

      * VERSE 2.For they being ignorant of Gods righteouſnes, and going about to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe, haue not ſubmitted themſelues to the righteouſnes of God.

      * VERSE 4.For Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to euery one that beleeueth.

      * VERSE 5.For Moſes deſcribeth the righteouſneſſe which is of the Lawe, thatLeuit. 18.5. Ezech.
20.11. Gal. 3.12.the man which doth thoſe things ſhall liue by them.6.But the righteouſneſſe which is of faith, ſpeaketh on this wiſe;Deut. 30.12.Say not in thy heart, Who ſhall aſcend into Heauen? That is, to bring Chriſt downe from aboue.7.Or, Who ſhall deſcend into the Deepe? that is to bring vp Christ againe from the dead.8.But what ſayth it?Deut. 30.14.The Word is nigh thee, euen in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that is the Word of faith which we preach.

      * VERSE 9.That if thou ſhalt confeſſe with thy mouth the Lord Ieſus, and ſhalt beleeue in thy heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaued.10.For with the heart man beleeueth vnto righteouſneſſe, and with the mouth confeſsion is made vnto ſaluation.

      * VERSE 11.For the Scripture ſaith,Eſay 28.16.Whoſoeuer belieueth on him, ſhall not be aſhamed.

      * VERSE 12.For there is no difference betweene the Iew and the Greeke: for the ſame Lord ouer all, is rich vnto all that call vpon him.

      * VERSE 13.Ioel. 2.32. Act.
2.21.For whoſoeuer ſhall call on the Name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaued.

      * VERSE 14.How then ſhall they call on him, in whom they haue not belieued? and how ſhall they belieue in him of whom they haue not heard? and how ſhall they heare without a Preacher?15.And how ſhall they preach except they be ſent? as it is written,Eſay 52.7. Naum.
1.15.How beautifull are the feet of them, that preach the Goſpel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things?16.But they haue not all obeyed the Goſpel: For Eſayas ſaith,Eſay 53.1. Iohn
12.38.Lord, who hath belieued ourOr Preaching. Gr. the hearing of vs.report?17.So then, Faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.

      * VERSE 15.As it is written, How beautifull are the feete of thoſe which preach the Goſpell of Peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!

      * VERSE 16.But they haue not all obeyed the Goſpell, for Eſayas ſaith, Lord, who hath belieued our report?

      * VERSE 18.But I ſay, Haue they not heard? Yes verily,Pſal. 19.4.their ſound went into all the earth, and their words vnto the ends of the world.

      * VERSE 19.But I ſay, did not Iſrael know? Firſt, Moſes ſaith,Deut. 32.31.I will prouoke you to iealouſie by them that are no people, and by a fooliſh Nation I will anger you.

      * VERSE 20.But Eſayas is very bold, and ſaith;Eſay. 65.1.I was found of them that ſought me not: I was made manifeſt vnto them that asked not after me.

      * VERSE 21.But to Iſrael hee ſaith,Eſay. 65.2.All day long I haue ſtretched out my hands to a diſobedient and gaineſaying people.

      * VERS. 1.I ſay then, Hath God caſt away his people? God forbid. For I alſo am an Iſraelite, of the ſeed of Abraham, of the tribe of Beniamin.

      * VERSE 2.For I alſo am an Iſraelite, of the ſeed of Abraham, of the tribe of Beniamin.

      * VERS. 2.God hath not caſt away his people which he foreknew.

      * VERSE 2.Wote you not what the ſcripture ſaith of Elias? How be maketh intercesſion to GOD againſt
Iſrael, ſaying.3Lord they haue killed thy prophets, and digged downe thine Alters, and I am left alone, and they ſeeke my life.4But what ſayth the anſwere of God vnto him. I haue reſerued to my ſelfe 7000 men who haue not bowed the knee to the Image of Baal.

      * VERSE. 2.How he makes interceſsion to God againſt Iſraell ſaying.

      * VERSE 3.Lord they haue killed thy Prophets, and digged downe thine Altars; and I am left alone, and they ſeeke my life.

      * VERSE. 4.But what ſayth the anſwere of God vnto him? I haue reſerued to my ſelfe 7000 men who haue not bowed the knee to the Image of Baal.

      * VERSE. 4.I haue reſerued to my ſelfe
7000 men who haue not bowed the knee to the Image of Baal.

      * VERSE 5.Euen ſo at this preſent time alſo there is a remnant, according to the election of Grace.

      * VERSE. 6.And if by Grace, then is it no more of workes, otherwiſe Grace were no more Grace? But if it be of workes, then is it no more grace, otherwiſe worke is no more worke.

      * VERSE. 7.What then? Iſrael hath not obtained that which he ſeeketh for, but the election hath obtained it, and the reſt were blinded.Or hardned.

      * VERSE 8.According as it is written,Eſay 29.10.God hath giuen them the ſpirit of ſlumber,or remorſe.eyes that they ſhould not ſee,Eſay. 6.9.& eares that they ſhould not heare vnto this day.

      * VERSE 9.And Dauid ſaithPſal. 69.22.Let their table be made a ſnare, and a trap, and a ſtumbling blocke, and a recompence vnto them.10.Pſal. 69.23.Let their eyes be darkned that they may not ſee, and bow downe their backe alway.

      * VERSE 11.I ſay then; Haue they ſtumbled that they ſhould fall? God forbid, but rather through their fall ſaluation is come to the Gentiles, to prouke them to Idolatry.

      * VERSE 12.Now if the fall of them be the Riches of the world, and the diminiſhing of them,Or decay, or loſſe.the riches of the Gentiles: How much more their fulneſſe?

      * VERSE. 13.For I ſpeake to you Gentiles, in as much as I am the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, I magnifie mine office.14.If by any meanes I may prouoke to emulation, them which are my fleſh, and might ſaue ſome of them.

      * VERSE 15.For if the caſting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what ſhall the receiuing of them be, but life from the dead?

      * VERSE 16.For if the firſt fruite be holy, the lumpe is alſo holy: and if the roote be holy, ſo are the branches.

      * VERSE. 17.And if ſome of the branches be broken off, and thou being a wild oliue tree, wert graffed in a mongſt them. And with them partakeſt of the root and fatnes of the oliue tree.18.Boaſt not thy ſelfe againſt the branches: but if thou boaſt thou beareſt not the root, but the root thee.

      * VERSE. 19.Thou wilt ſay then, the branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.20Well, becauſe of vnbeleefe they were broken off, and thou ſtandeſt by faith: Bee not high minded, but feare.

      * VERSE. 20.—Be not high minded but feare.

      * VERSE 20.—But feare.

      * VERSE 21.For if God ſpared not the naturall branches, take heed leſt he alſo ſpare not thee.

      * VERSE. 22.Behold therefore the goodnes and ſeuerity of God; on them which fell, ſeuerity: but towards thee, goodneſſe, if thou continue in his goodneſſe: otherwiſe thou alſo ſhalt be cut off.

      * VERSE. 23.And they alſo if they bide not ſtill in vnbeleefe, ſhall be graffed in, for God is able to graffe them in againe.

      * VERSE. 24.For if thou wert cut out of the Oliue tree, which is wilde by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good Oliue tree: how much more ſhal theſe which be the Naturall branches bee graffed, into their tree?

      * VERSE 25.For I would not brethren that ye ſhould be ignorant of this mystery, left you ſhould be wiſe in your owne conceits, that blindneſſeor hardneſſe.in part is hapned to Iſrael, vntill the fulneſſe of the Gentiles be come in.26.And ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaued.

      * VERSE. 26.As it is written,Eſay. 59 20.then ſhall come out of Syon the deliuerer, and ſhall turne away vngodlines from
Iacob.27For this is my couenant vnto them, when I ſhall take away their ſinnes.

      * VERSE 28.As concerning the Goſpell, they are enemies for your ſake: but as touching the election, they are beloued for the fathers ſakes.

      * VERSE 29.For the gifts and calling of God, are without repentance.

      * VERSE. 30.For as yee in times paſt, haue not beleeuedOr obeyed.God, yet haue now obtained mercy through their vnbeleefe.31.Euen ſo haue theſe alſo now not beleeued,Or obeyed.that through your mercie, they alſo may obtaine mercie.

      * VERSE 31.Euen ſo haue theſe alſo now not beleeued,Or obeyed.that through your mercie they alſo might obtaine mercie.

      * VERSE. 32.For God hath concluded them all in vnbeleefe,Or ſhutte them all vp together.that he might haue mercie on all.

      * VERSE 32.—That he might haue mercie on all.

      * VERSE 33.O the depth of the riches, both of the wiſdome and knowledge of God! How vnſearchable are his iudgments, and his wayes paſt finding out!34.Eſay 40.13. Wiſd. 9.13. 1. Cor.
2.16.For who hath knowne the mind of the Lord, or who hath beene his counſeller?35.Or who hath firſt giuen him, and it ſhall be recompenſed him againe?

      * VERSE 36.For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.
